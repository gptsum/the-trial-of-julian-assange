### Introduction

For a special rapporteur of the United Nations, writing a book is not really part of the job description. Especially not a book on an individual case. An explanation is therefore in order. This book is intended to be an urgent appeal. An admonition to the international community of states that the system they have established for the protection of human rights is failing in a very fundamental way. A wake-up call to the general public, because a systemic failure of such magnitude ought to raise alarm bells with any ordinary citizen of a democratic state. A call, therefore, that should also be understood as a personal challenge to each and every one of us: to open our eyes, to face the truth, and to take personal and political responsibility.

As the special rapporteur on torture, I am mandated by the United Nations Human Rights Council to monitor compliance with the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment worldwide, to examine allegations of violations, and to transmit queries and recommendations to the states concerned with a view to clarifying individual cases. I was entrusted with this important mandate because I have been dealing with violations of human rights and humanitarian law for more than twenty years, whether as a senior security policy advisor to my government, as a professor of international law and an expert author, or as a Red Cross delegate and legal advisor in contexts of war and crisis. I have visited thousands of prisoners, refugees and their loved ones on four continents, many of them victims of torture and violence. I have negotiated not only in palaces, ministries and command centres, but also with soldiers and rebels in the no-man’s-land between front lines.

Hence, when I investigate allegations of torture and ill-treatment, I know what I am talking about. I am not easily manipulated and don’t tend to exaggerate, nor do I seek the limelight. My world is one of diplomatic dialogue and mutual respect – but always also of truth and integrity, because diplomacy must never be allowed to become an end in itself but must always remain a means to a higher end. In my case, this higher end is to achieve compliance with the universal prohibition of torture and ill-treatment, as well as the investigation, punishment and redress of violations. This purpose I must always pursue and may never sacrifice. If it can no longer be achieved through diplomatic channels, then I must choose other means. One of these means, dear reader, is the present book. Thus, to rephrase a martial maxim for my peaceful purposes, this book could be described as the continuation of diplomacy by other means.

I write this book because, when investigating the case of Julian Assange, I came across compelling evidence of political persecution and gross judicial arbitrariness, as well as of deliberate torture and ill-treatment. But the responsible states refused to cooperate with me in clearing up these allegations, and to initiate the investigative measures required by international law. I visited Julian Assange in prison with a team of medical doctors and spoke to the authorities in charge, as well as to lawyers, witnesses and experts. I have repeatedly expressed my concerns to all four states involved – the United Kingdom, Sweden, Ecuador and the United States – through the official channels available to me. I have requested clarifications and recommended specific measures. None of the four governments were willing to engage in a constructive dialogue. Instead, I was confronted with diplomatic platitudes or sweeping rhetorical attacks. When I insisted, the dialogue was terminated by the governments. At the same time, the persecution and mistreatment of Julian Assange intensified, violations of his due process rights became increasingly blatant and my public appeals calling on the authorities to respect human rights were ignored. Even from within the UN system, I received hardly any support, with the notable exception of a few courageous and determined individuals. I expressed my concern about the obstructive stance of the involved states both at the Human Rights Council in Geneva and at the General Assembly in New York – without any substantial reaction. I repeatedly asked the High Commissioner for Human Rights for a personal meeting about the matter, but was fobbed off. I called on other states to exert their influence, but virtually always faced an awkward wall of silence. The institutions and processes I had always believed in were failing before my eyes.

You may wonder why I should speak out so forcefully in this particular case. After all, Julian Assange is hardly the only victim of torture who has not received justice, nor is his abuse the most severe form of torture I have encountered in my work. All of this is correct. The reason for my strong engagement in this case is that its importance extends far beyond Julian Assange as an individual and, indeed, far beyond the states directly involved. It reveals a generalized systemic failure gravely undermining the integrity of our democratic institutions, our fundamental rights, and the rule of law more generally. It is a systemic failure that I routinely encounter in my daily work, but that usually plays out behind the scenes, and therefore remains largely concealed from the broader public.

The Assange case is the story of a man who is being persecuted and abused for exposing the dirty secrets of the powerful, including war crimes, torture and corruption. It is a story of deliberate judicial arbitrariness in Western democracies that are otherwise keen to present themselves as exemplary in the area of human rights. It is a story of wilful collusion by intelligence services behind the backs of national parliaments and the general public. It is a story of manipulated and manipulative reporting in the mainstream media for the purpose of deliberately isolating, demonizing, and destroying a particular individual. It is the story of a man who has been scapegoated by all of us for our own societal failure to address government corruption and state-sanctioned crimes. It is thus also a story about each and every one of us, our lethargy, our self-deception and our co-responsibility for the political, economic and human tragedies of our time.

For two years I have intensively investigated the case of Julian Assange. For two years, I have unsuccessfully tried to get the responsible states to cooperate, and for two years I have publicly communicated my concerns – in official reports, press releases and interviews, before international bodies and parliamentary groups, but also during academic panel discussions and at numerous other events. Now the time has come to publish this book, which summarizes my investigation and conclusions, as well as the available evidence, in an easily accessible form. I decided to take this step because I had run out of viable options within the system, and because my silence or inaction would have been tantamount to complicity in the cover-up of serious crimes, both those exposed by Assange and those committed against him and, thus, against all of us. In exercising my mandate, I do not feel responsible primarily to the serving governments, but to the UN member states themselves and to their people. They have committed to compliance with universal human rights and, therefore, they are also entitled to know what their governments are doing with the power delegated to them. This is especially true when it comes to the practice of torture and abuse, when our fundamental freedoms of expression, of the press, and of information are being deliberately suppressed, and when those in power claim impunity for corruption and the most serious crimes. So, I suppose, in a way, by writing this book, I have become a whistleblower myself.

I have always carried out my investigations objectively and impartially, duly considering all of the available evidence and reaching my conclusions in good faith and to the best of my judgment and conviction. In the case of Julian Assange, this process was rendered particularly difficult by the complete refusal of the involved governments to cooperate with my investigation and to provide the requested evidence and clarifications. Nevertheless, over time, I managed to accumulate around 10,000 pages of reliable procedural files, correspondence and other evidence from a multitude of sources. While for reasons of privacy and source protection names will be used only where necessary for the credibility of my conclusions, I am deeply indebted to countless individuals for valuable information and support of all kinds. All those concerned know who they are and that this book could not have been written without their precious help.

My investigation of the Assange case can be compared to assembling a huge puzzle, piece by piece. Much like a detective, I had to solve an equation with many unknowns in the hope of disentangling the institutional responsibilities for a serious crime. While numerous important puzzle pieces may still be missing, the overall picture is consistent and convincing. That said, as long as the involved states continue to hide behind a convenient veil of secrecy, my conclusions admittedly cannot be regarded as absolute, complete and final. Rather, they should be seen as the result of two years of careful investigation carried out under adverse circumstances. Should the governments in question decide to cease their obstruction and provide contradicting evidence or clarifications, any such input will be gratefully received and taken into account in my future pronouncements in this case. An important purpose of this book – establishing the truth – would then have been achieved.

My most important message is that, ultimately, the trial of Assange is not really about Assange. It is about the integrity of our constitutional institutions and, thus, the essence of the “republic” in the original sense of the word. At stake is nothing less than the future of democracy. I do not intend to leave to our children a world where governments can disregard the rule of law with impunity, and where telling the truth has become a crime. I have always understood my UN mandate as a duty to use my privileged position in order to protect human rights, to expose violations and systemic shortcomings, and to fight for the integrity of our institutions – ‘speaking truth to power’, as it has been so aptly termed. This I have done since I was first appointed by the Human Rights Council. I have addressed issues as diverse as police brutality, the inhumanity of prevailing migration policies, psychological methods of torture, and the cruelty of domestic violence. I have also highlighted the interrelations between corruption and torture, as well as the collective patterns of self-deception without which torture and ill-treatment could not be practiced with such impunity worldwide.

My work did not make me popular with everyone, because I challenged the impunity of the powerful and the hypocrisy of the self-righteous. In the specific case of Julian Assange, I have been repeatedly accused of betraying my neutrality and impartiality in order to side with Assange. This is not the case. If anything, I was initially biased against Assange and even refused to get involved in his case. Throughout my career, I have attached great importance to the objectivity, neutrality and impartiality of my work. But once my investigation of a case leads to the conclusion that serious human rights violations have indeed been committed, I cannot reasonably be expected to remain neutral between perpetrators and victims. My objectivity as an independent legal expert then requires me to side with the victim of torture, with human rights and with justice. I therefore write this book not as a lawyer for Julian Assange, but as an advocate for humanity, truth, and the rule of law.
