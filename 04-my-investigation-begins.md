### Chapter 4: My Investigation Begins

#### Visit to HMP Belmarsh

By the time I began my investigation, I was keenly aware of the enormous political dimension of this case. There was a real danger that people would try to manipulate me and abuse my mandate. I therefore had to remain cautious and wary of any attempts to influence me, no matter where they came from. In order to avoid any suspicion of a conflict of interest, I had to keep my distance, both from the authorities involved and from Julian Assange’s supporters. I needed to collect as many reliable facts as possible and to triangulate my own observations with the assessments made by other experts, lawyers and witnesses, as well as with the positions taken by the authorities.

My visit to Julian Assange in London’s Belmarsh high-security prison had been approved by the British Ministry of Justice for 9 May 2019. I wanted to personally examine Assange’s health, prison conditions, and treatment so that I could draw clear conclusions based on reliable information. What impact, if any, had almost seven years of confinement in the Ecuadorian embassy had on Assange’s physical health? What had been the psychological effects of being trapped for so long and exposed to a progressively hostile environment of isolation, reprisals and the constant danger of extradition? From the perspective of my mandate, everything ultimately boiled down to a single question: was there credible evidence that Julian Assange was, had been or might be exposed to an act or risk of torture or ill-treatment, whether currently in British custody, previously at the Ecuadorian embassy, or in the event of his extradition to the United States?

Whatever my findings, at least one party in this strongly politicized case would probably try to question my motives and undermine my credibility. It was therefore particularly important for me to be able to rely not only on my personal judgment and experience but also on the expertise of independent medical professionals. I therefore asked two medical doctors specialized in the examination of torture victims to accompany me on my visit. I had worked with both of them before, including during numerous prison visits, and was confident that I could rely on their professional and personal integrity. Professor Duarte Nuno Vieira was dean and professor for forensic medicine at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Coimbra in Portugal, chairman of numerous professional associations and, until a few years ago, president of the International Association of Forensic Sciences. A world-class forensic expert who had seen it all – from the mass graves of the Yugoslav War to the bodies recovered from the wreck of MH17, the Malaysian airliner shot down by a Russian-built missile over eastern Ukraine in 2014.

Dr Pau Pérez-Sales was a psychiatrist at La Paz University Hospital in Madrid, an internationally recognized specialist and author in the field of psychological torture and former director of a rehabilitation centre for torture victims, at the Mental Health and Human Rights Resource Centre in Madrid. Both Professor Vieira and Dr Pérez-Sales were world-renowned experts in identifying, examining, and documenting possible traces of physical and psychological torture or other ill-treatment, and were regularly called upon as expert witnesses by national and international courts and institutions. Neither of them would ever think of using the Assange case for their own profiling, and both would strictly adhere to medical confidentiality and leave any public statements following the prison visit to me as the mandate holder. This was important, because the purpose of my mandate was not, of course, to disclose confidential medical information to the public, but to use our medical diagnosis as a basis for my legal assessment as to whether the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment had been violated.

In line with customary practice, the medical report would not be made available to the authorities, nor to Assange or his legal team, but would be kept under lock and key at the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and used exclusively as the medical basis for my official findings. On the one hand, Assange needed to be sure that the medical information he entrusted us with would not be used against him. On the other, the confidentiality of our diagnosis also had to apply to Assange himself, as it would not have been acceptable to give him preferential treatment in this investigation. Given that my official conclusions would not be legally binding for either party or for the United Nations, but that they had the evidentiary strength of an expert opinion, the non-disclosure of the underlying medical diagnosis remained compatible with the principles of due process. In order to ensure maximum objectivity and credibility, I had instructed both doctors to conduct their medical examination in line with the ‘Istanbul Protocol’ – a UN document enshrining the internationally recognized legal standards and medical guidelines on how to effectively investigate and document allegations of torture and ill-treatment.

On the morning of 9 May, we took a black cab from our hotel in central London to Thamesmead, about ten miles east of Tower Bridge and Big Ben. Her Majesty’s Prison Belmarsh is a thirty-year-old, high-security prison with a capacity of about 900 inmates. In the media, Belmarsh is frequently referred to as Britain’s Guantánamo Bay. Not only because it houses quite a few terrorism suspects, but also because of the strict security regime. Assange was brought to Belmarsh on 11 April 2019, immediately after his arrest and conviction by the British authorities. At the time of our visit, that was barely a month ago.

We stepped out of the cab. I had already seen photographs of the place, but its dimensions remained imposing. It was a rectangular compound enclosed by high walls, which looked a bit like a medieval fortress. The prison reception was located behind the main portal built of clinker bricks. I reported to the receptionist presenting my official UN identification and the credentials provided by the Ministry of Justice. Everywhere in the world, whenever I conduct an official prison visit in my capacity as a UN special rapporteur, my team and I are immediately welcomed by the governor and their key staff. We are smoothly escorted through the security barriers, usually without any search, and we are not asked to hand over our documents, or cell phones, as we may need the latter to photographically register physical traces of torture and evidence of inadequate material conditions of detention. Also, in cases of emergency, we have to be able to communicate with the outside world. From the provincial prisons in the Ukraine to the gigantic Silivri complex in Turkey and the closed psychiatric ward in Argentina: with a few regrettable exceptions, prison managements tend to go out of their way to demonstrate their respect for the United Nations.

Not so in Belmarsh. The reception staff had obviously not received any particular instructions with a view to the appropriate handling of an official visit from the United Nations. After a remarkably unhurried verification of our papers, we were first sent back to the visitor centre, a few minutes’ walk away, where we were asked to deposit our bags, computers, phones, keys and valuables in lockers. Once back at the reception desk, we were asked to move to the opposite corner of the entrance hall, where other visitors – presumably family members and lawyers – were already queuing to get through the first of several security gates. We got in line. My two doctors were growing visibly impatient, but I urged them to remain calm: ‘Don’t be provoked, my friends – I am sure there is more to come.’

Given the well-known British predilection for formal etiquette, diplomatic protocol and indirect messaging, this kind of lukewarm welcome clearly was not an accidental oversight on the part of the authorities. From the first moment, I was made to understand that, in the United Kingdom, special rapporteurs cannot expect special treatment. We were not treated as an institutional partner, but as a potential security risk. I took this for what it was: a form of communication, but also a demonstration of power. My visit was being tolerated, nothing more.

Not that this upset me. Particularly during my field deployments with the Red Cross, I had developed a thick skin playing the waiting game at barriers, fences, gates and checkpoints. So many times, and in so many places, I had been blocked for endless hours in dusty heat, pouring rain and freezing cold, waiting to finally get through to the other side, where our humanitarian action was needed. Whether I was facing indifferent soldiers, nervous rebels or frustrated border guards, never did I allow myself to react emotionally, for the goodwill of my interlocutors was fragile, short-lived and sometimes quite literally a question of life or death. Against this background, the unenthusiastic reception at Belmarsh could not deter me, but it certainly contributed to my rapidly declining perception of Britain as a reliable partner in the area of human rights. In the war zones of Kosovo and Afghanistan, my dialogue with British operational forces had always been constructive, efficient and marked by mutual respect. Here in London, the United Kingdom showed me a very different face – an attitude of demonstrative indifference, with a hint of royal condescension. The motivation for all of this was not personal, of course, but purely political. The interests pursued by governments are always political, and their priority is never the promotion of human rights. If and when human rights are put on the political agenda, it almost always serves ulterior motives such as enhancing national reputation, denigrating other states, obtaining financial aid packages, or justifying military interventions.

So, I was not disconcerted when the security check at Belmarsh dragged on. The security officers went about their business with painstaking meticulousness and did everything in their power to ensure that the UN special rapporteur and his medical team would not be smuggling drugs, weapons or other prohibited items into the prison. Together with the other visitors we inched forward. From the queue at reception, we squeezed into a densely packed first lock and then, a few eternal minutes later, through metal detectors into the inner area. Here, the actual security check took place. Removal of shoes, jackets and watches; then an individual parade, in our socks, through even more powerful metal detectors and, after a thorough inspection of the doctor’s clinical thermometer, stethoscope and ballpoint pen, and a tick-off on our list of pre-authorized items, a second passage through the X-ray machine for us and all of our shoes. Only then were we admitted. The security officers themselves had no bad intentions, for sure, they had simply not been given any special instructions. As a result, they did their job with the usual thoroughness, and any protest or lack of cooperation on our part would have immediately triggered a forceful response. And, probably, would have meant the end of my visit. This is how ‘soft harassment’ works. We endured the procedure stoically – which seemed to be slightly more taxing for my Iberian colleagues than for my Swiss-Swedish temperament.

Behind the security check we were welcomed by a female officer, whose open and friendly demeanour made a pleasant contrast with the government’s demonstrative indifference. She explained that she had been tasked with accompanying us throughout the visit and escorted us to Belmarsh’s health care unit. This had been one of my requests. I did not want to meet Assange in the usual visitors’ quarters. A conversation or a medical examination, with other prisoners and their relatives present, was out of the question. Moreover, such rooms are almost always covered by CCTV and offer no confidentiality whatsoever.

We passed through corridors and barred doors that were immediately locked behind us. The room we were finally assigned to was not very different from the examination room in an ordinary doctor’s surgery. White walls, a desk with a computer and a few chairs, an examination couch, and a door with a window made of thick glass and covered with adjustable blinds. As a matter of routine, I quickly checked the room for visible cameras and microphones, including under the desk and chairs. I did not find anything, of course, but I was not reassured. I knew that modern surveillance technology had lately reached a level of sophistication that made its detection virtually impossible.

Above the door, a clock marked every second with an audible click. The minutes passed. We waited. A total of four hours had been agreed for our personal meetings with Assange, from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 and from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m. But it was already well past 10:30 a.m. when the door finally opened and Assange was brought in. I immediately knew that this was the moment to put my foot down. As long as our exposure to ‘soft harassment’ did not interfere with the agreed purpose and modalities of my visit, the only reaction I would show was unshakeable patience. But the duration of our confidential meetings with Assange was non-negotiable. I formally protested with our liaison officer and insisted that the session would have to be extended to compensate for our waiting time. While my demand was being processed and, ultimately, approved through the institutional hierarchy, the clock kept ticking. Next, I had to insist that our liaison officer leave the room so that we could interview Assange in confidence.

Although interviews without witnesses had long been part of the standard modalities applicable to all detention visits carried out by UN experts worldwide, and despite express prior notification, this had not, it seemed, been contemplated, so that permission had once more to be obtained through the institutional hierarchy. As we waited, the clock kept ticking louder and louder. Finally, and for good measure, the special permission procedure had to be repeated a third time because, although authorized to leave the examination room, our liaison officer had been instructed to visually monitor our meeting with Assange through the window in the door. On this point, resistance got more tenacious, but I categorically insisted on medical confidentiality and finally achieved agreement that the blinds would remain closed for the entire duration of our meetings, and that our liaison officer could not enter the room without first knocking on the door. Then, at last, we were alone.

#### First Impressions

When Assange entered, he immediately sought eye contact. He looked tense and nervous, as if he were unsure what to expect from his external visitors. But I soon realized that I didn’t need to explain my function to him. He was well aware of the UN’s human rights mechanisms – at least since the WGAD had concluded, in December 2015, that his continued confinement at the embassy amounted to a form of arbitrary deprivation of liberty.

Assange wore a blue sweatshirt, grey track pants and sneakers. Clean-shaven, his white hair neatly trimmed, he bore no resemblance to the man who had been dragged out of the Ecuadorian embassy a few weeks earlier. Then Assange had looked unkempt, pale and much older, with long, matted hair and a messy beard. The pictures had gone around the world. What the public had not been told, however, was that Assange’s squalid appearance had been deliberately staged by the Ecuadorian authorities to make him look repulsive and bizarre in the media. According to Assange, three months before his arrest, his shaving kit had been taken away by the embassy’s security personnel – one of countless small reprisals with which they obstructed his daily struggle for a dignified existence.

Seemingly a minor detail, it fit perfectly with the narrative assiduously spread by the Ecuadorian government about Assange being an ungrateful, self-indulgent parasite who skate-boarded and played soccer inside the embassy, mistreated his cat, and smeared faeces on the walls. But the images and video clips released to the public told a different story. They mainly showed Assange’s meetings with medical doctors, lawyers and other visitors, as well as completely innocuous scenes from his private life – all recorded in secret and published without his authorization. The few visitors Assange was still allowed to receive during his last year at the embassy also reported systematic surveillance, abusive restrictions and harassment, and even tampering with their cell phones and devices which had been deposited with security personnel. Assange’s expulsion without any form of due process had been planned well in advance, and it was clear that the general public was more likely to accept this step without sympathy or protest if during his arrest Assange looked as filthy and dehumanized as he had been portrayed in the media.

I intended to use the first hour for my bilateral conversation with Assange, and then hand over to Professor Vieira for the forensic examination. As always in my interviews with individual prisoners, the purpose of the first few minutes was to build trust and ask standard questions about well-being, conditions of detention, contacts with family and lawyers, and any other primary concerns. This normally allows me to quickly get a reliable overview of the situation and its potential challenges. Depending on the complexity of an individual case, working through a list of basic questions usually takes around ten to twenty minutes. It takes incomparably longer, however, when the prisoner tries to take the lead himself and asks completely different questions. Assange pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket on which he had scribbled several names. Suddenly I was being interviewed. Had I been in contact with this lawyer yet? Had I met that UN official? Every time I tried to steer the conversation back on course, Assange’s mind was already elsewhere, and he asked the next question. It seemed as if he couldn’t really process what I was saying. Again he interrupted, this time to engage me in a weighty discussion about what he saw as the waning influence of human rights mechanisms. His statements were clear and convincing, but at the same time seemed erratic and almost rushed. As soon as he had expressed a thought, he instantly opened a new drawer in his mind, as it were, and pulled out another topic.

I have been visiting prisoners for twenty years in a wide variety of contexts. Prisons are a difficult environment for open conversations, and many inmates are intimidated, distrustful, and traumatized. Over time, I’ve learned to also pay attention to non-verbal signals: body language, mood shifts, everything that is perceptible without being explicitly articulated. When talking to Julian Assange, I was immediately reminded of conversations with other political prisoners who had been isolated for a long time. All of them had thought about their own situation for many, many hours – often too many. But because of their isolation they were unable to process and express more than a fraction of their thoughts and emotions with other people. As a result, they lived in an increasingly self-contained, overstimulated inner world with thoughts and emotions slowly spinning out of control. It is a well-known phenomenon of prolonged solitary confinement. At some point, this leads to a permanent state of stress and apprehension. The accumulated tension can no longer be relieved, and a vicious cycle of insomnia, anxiety and depression begins, often to the point of total exhaustion and with potentially severe neurological and cardiovascular consequences. The corrosive effect of isolation can also be seen in a prisoner’s posture, facial expressions and gestures. They appear fragile, overwhelmed and rushed. Their ability to absorb and process information is diminished. They seem to have lost their grip internally because they have been deliberately deprived of all certainties. The psychological destabilization caused by isolation and arbitrariness is routinely employed by torturers in order to break the victim’s resistance.

My impression of Assange was that of a highly intelligent, mentally extremely resilient man who was desperately trying to retain some measure of control over his own fate, even though it was obvious that he was no longer in charge. This, too, is a typical reaction of people exposed to a hostile and arbitrary environment for a prolonged period. In reality, they are completely defenceless, and they know it. Nevertheless, somehow, they still cling to the idea of having that last ace up their sleeve which would turn the tide in their favour. But during my conversation with Assange, I also perceived a trait of his that had been mentioned by many others before, in more or less flattering terms depending on their perspective. While some had praised him for his extreme ability to concentrate, others had complained of his indifference towards the legitimate concerns of others. My own impression is that this divergence of views reflects two slightly distorted sides of the same coin. Although I had explained the purpose of our interview to Assange, it was difficult to keep the conversation on track, and I repeatedly had to perform rhetorical U-turns to make sure I obtained the information I needed.

However, I did not experience Assange as self-indulgent or arrogant at all. He was simply too focused on his own thoughts to pay attention to what I had in mind unless and until I clearly verbalized it – a symptom congruent with his medical diagnosis of Asperger’s, a mild form of autism. Had Assange been a ruthless narcissist, as some insist, he would hardly have been prepared to endure so much personal humiliation, isolation and suffering for the sake of truth and justice for others. Had his quest been his own self-aggrandizement, then his continued confrontation with the world’s most powerful governments certainly had not produced the desired results. Assange was too intelligent not to understand the risks to his own reputation and well-being when he decided to expose the dirty secrets of the most powerful. He knew the price for his actions, and he decided to pay it – not for personal benefit, but because he believed it needed to be done.

The two doctors had followed our conversation from the background, so they could get a first impression and avoid repeating the same basic questions during their examination. After one hour, I thanked Assange, explained the rest of my visit and handed over to Professor Vieira for the first part of the medical examination. Together with Dr Pérez-Sales, I went to the chief nurse’s office to have a copy of Assange’s medical records printed out, with Assange’s consent, and to get the prison doctors’ opinion on various aspects of his health. However, not a single prison doctor was said to be present all day. In a high-security prison with almost 1,000 inmates. At the time of an officially announced visit by a UN expert and his medical team. This no longer seemed like a mere coincidence; more like another variation of ‘soft harassment’.

After some unexpected technical difficulties with the printer, which we met with our default attitude of unshakeable patience, we at least received a copy of Assange’s medical records – another non-negotiable element of my visit. According to these, the prison doctors had already taken the most urgent dental and other measures to treat the most pressing physical ailments that had arisen during Assange’s asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy. Nevertheless, he was not in good health. As our physical examination showed, he had lost weight since his arrest and the constant anxiety and stress of the past months and years had caused neurological and cognitive impairments that were already objectively measurable.

In the run-up to my visit, I had announced that I would be available to respond to questions from the press during the lunch break. But when I arrived at the designated meeting place in front of the prison, only one journalist was waiting. He worked for Ruptly, a news agency affiliated with Russia’s state-run RT television network. I delivered a short statement into his video camera, thanking the British Ministry of Justice for its cooperation and explaining the procedure and purpose of my stay in London. It would include not only today’s prison visit to Assange, but also a meeting the following day with representatives of the British authorities and other interlocutors. As expressly agreed with the British government, I announced that the results of my investigation would first be transmitted to the British authorities and then also shared with the public.

Given the prominence of the Assange case and the public announcement of my visit, I had expected strong interest from the British mainstream media, including the BBC, Sky News, the *Guardian* and the *Times*. Instead, there was only a lone reporter from Ruptly.

I was more surprised than disappointed. On the one hand, the low turnout was not inconvenient, as I was keen to avoid burdening my investigation and mediation efforts with sensational headlines. On the other hand, I had certainly not expected total radio silence from the mainstream media. I later learned that, on the same day, the Swedish Prosecution Authority had publicly announced that in four days’ time it would publicly announce whether the criminal investigation against Assange for rape, that had been closed two years earlier, was to be reopened. An announcement of an announcement, so to speak. Was its temporal concurrence with my visit to Assange a coincidence, or a well-planned device to tie up media attention? Or were there perhaps entirely different reasons for the lack of media interest in my visit? I was still far from understanding the true dimensions of this case. For the moment, I was just relieved that public attention to my investigation of this highly politicized case had been postponed.

A few minutes’ walk from Belmarsh, on Battery Road, we found a Domino’s Pizza. We placed our orders and sat down on the only two benches that could fit in the small storefront. Outside, people went about their business under a grey drizzly sky, for most of them no doubt just an ordinary day of British spring weather. It felt strange to be waiting for food, Coke in hand, discussing impressions and next steps in whispered innuendos. There were only a few hundred yards between Belmarsh and Domino’s, and yet the prison walls separated two fundamentally different worlds.

#### ‘Please, save my life!’

In the afternoon, we returned to the prison reception early, well aware that we would have to go through the entire security procedure all over again. While Dr Pérez-Sales conducted the psychiatric examination, Professor Vieira and I, with Assange’s consent, visited his cell and other relevant parts of the prison. The same officer who had been assigned to us in the morning led us through the corridors and willingly answered all our questions. At no point did we experience or observe any cynicism or hostility on the part of the prison staff, whether towards us or towards Assange or the other inmates. They had the challenging task of managing the security and daily routine of nearly 1,000 inmates and, as far as we could tell, they were all doing their jobs with a calm, friendly and professional attitude. As I knew too well, this could not be taken for granted. In many places around the world, prison staff had made no secret of what they thought of us visiting the ‘enemy’, the ‘traitors’, the ‘terrorists’, or whatever unflattering term they had reserved for the people in their custody, and the relationship between guards and inmates was often marked by a palpable atmosphere of fear and violence. Not so here. Assange may have been considered a public enemy by the governments of many countries, but not by the guards in Belmarsh. If anything, I had the impression that the prison staff were anxious to protect him from the ‘bad influence’ of other prisoners, some of whom had committed very serious crimes. As a non-violent political prisoner, Assange should never have been brought to Belmarsh.

We visited the library, the gym, the shower rooms, and the courtyard for outdoor walks. Like in most high-security prisons, the individual cell wings at Belmarsh each spread over two floors, but were strictly separated from the other wings, so as to facilitate de-escalation and restoration of control in the event of a riot. For individual inmates, the daily routine depends largely on their assigned security regime. In the United Kingdom, the spectrum ranges from Category A (maximum security) to Category D (open prison). At the time of our visit, Assange was assigned to Category B (high security). We learned about the daily routine there from the guards on duty and were able to cross-check the information with other sources: The inmates on Assange’s wing worked for three to four hours per day, one group in the morning and the other group in the afternoon. In the other half of the day, the cell doors were left open for three to four hours of socialization time, during which inmates could move freely around the corridors of their wing but were not allowed to enter other cells. Yard time depended on the weather, but was usually forty-five to sixty minutes per day. Cell doors remained closed for the rest of the day and during the night. All meals were taken inside the cells, mostly single cells and a few double cells.

Assange’s single cell was number 37 in Wing II. When the heavy steel door was opened, I immediately saw that the cell had been designed and equipped in conformity with the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, or the ‘Nelson Mandela Rules’, as they have been called since their revision in 2015. Nothing fancy, of course: about six square metres of floor space, well over two metres high, and a reasonably sized window. A plastic chair, a sink, a toilet, a closet, a simple bed and bedding. From the smell and the look, it was clear that the cell had just been freshly painted, possibly in anticipation of my visit, with water-resistant ‘laundry room’ eggshell. There is a short video clip circulating on the internet, which must have been secretly recorded a few days before my visit, and which shows Assange and another inmate preparing his cell for the paint job. On the lino floor, under the bed, and on every conceivable shelf lay books, handwritten notes, and countless letters from supporters around the world that evidently had been delivered to Assange by the prison authorities. Well, I thought, given that the internal mail distribution system seemed to work quite efficiently, there really was no excuse for Assange not receiving his legal correspondence and case documents, as he had complained.

Our liaison officer explained that Assange had not yet been integrated into the usual prison routine. One month after his arrest, he was still in the induction phase, which served to gradually integrate inmates into the system. Initially, detainees typically spent about twenty-two hours alone in their cells, interrupted only by meals, showers, and yard time, as well as any visits, medical appointments, or court hearings. Daily time for work and social interaction with other inmates, as well as access to the library and gym, would be added only later. In the case of Assange, she said, the prison management had to be particularly careful because Sweden had publicly portrayed him as a rape suspect for years. This image had become deeply entrenched in the minds of the prisoners, including a number of violent criminals whose behaviour was difficult to predict.

During the preparation for my visit, I had formally requested that a meeting with the prison governor be scheduled for the end of the day. It emerged, however, that he had ‘exceptionally’ gone home already at 4 p.m. that day, and so I ended up with his deputy. Yet another opportunity for the government to officially demonstrate how little importance it attached to my visit although, paradoxically, quite the opposite was really the case. In Britain, only a government feeling extremely uncomfortable about its role in this case would go out of its way to disregard just about every convention of diplomatic protocol and mutual respect, simply to downplay the political weight of my official visit. The deputy director himself, of course, behaved impeccably, provided me with all requested information and duly took note of my concerns. I cautioned that after a full month, it was time to end the restrictions of the induction period and to allow Assange access to the library, gym, and daily work. Most importantly, I made it clear that Assange urgently needed access to an independent psychiatrist he could trust, and that under the current security regime he was unable to adequately prepare for the upcoming court hearings. Unlike the vast majority of other inmates, he was simultaneously involved in complex legal proceedings in multiple jurisdictions. To prepare his defence, Assange clearly needed to be able to review and write documents on a computer, even without internet access, and to hold regular and intensive exchanges with his legal teams in the respective countries. Under the current detention regime in Belmarsh, this requirement simply could not be guaranteed in a manner consistent with human rights law. The deputy director took note, but then explained that it was the judge who had ordered Assange’s detention in Belmarsh and that the prison administration could not influence this decision in any way. The judge, of course, would subsequently argue that the responsibility for Assange’s well-being falls on the prison administration alone, and that the judiciary has no authority whatsoever to interfere with its decisions. Bureaucratic evasion of responsibility, if applied by the executive and the judiciary in mutual buck-passing, can be an effective method of undermining the rule of law.

Thus this important day came to an end. Not many words were exchanged in our black cab back to central London. I sat in the back of the car and stared through the raindrops on the right rear window into the void. In my mind, I kept replaying the moment of saying goodbye to Assange at the end of the afternoon. We had shaken hands, I wished him well and was about to leave, with the doctors already at the door. Then suddenly Assange’s grip on my hand tightened and he held me back. What he wanted to say was visibly difficult for him. ‘I hate to say this,’ he began. Then he hesitated for an eternal instant until the words finally spilled out: ‘Please, save my life!’ During our conversation, he had made it absolutely clear that he would not be extradited to the United States alive. In view of what awaited him there, this was a rational decision, he had said. During a cell search two days before our visit, prison staff had confiscated a razor blade hidden by Assange just in case. I knew he was serious, and he knew, of course, that his fate was not in my hands. As so often at the end of intense visits, I did the only humanely possible thing I could do in this situation – I gave him a silent hug, from one person to another. Then I heard myself reply, as if from afar: ‘I’ll do my best!’

#### Officials, Lawyers and Witnesses

In the afternoon of the following day, I met with the British authorities. Professor Vieira was due to testify in court elsewhere and had already left London, but Dr Pérez-Sales accompanied me to the headquarters of the Home Office in Marsham Street. During official visits by UN special rapporteurs, opening meetings with the authorities of the host state normally take place at the ministerial level, while the discussion of technical issues is subsequently delegated to the ‘working level’ – the people actually running the administration.

Not so in London, at least not in the Assange case. From the outset, I was confronted with administrative officials who could brief me on the applicable domestic normative, institutional and procedural framework, but – even with the best of intentions – were not in a position to discuss the political decisions that would have been necessary to resolve the Assange case. Again, I was being signalled that the British government tolerated my investigation as a matter of window-dressing but was not willing to seriously question its own approach.

With a minister, I could have addressed completely different questions. Home Secretary Sajid Javid, for instance, would personally sign off on the US extradition request for Assange only a few weeks later, and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was responsible for British relations with the United States, Ecuador, and Sweden, but also with the United Nations. With them, I could have discussed the political and human rights implications of the Assange case and explored face-saving compromise solutions that would have been acceptable to all parties. But that was obviously not what the British government had in mind. Instead, they preferred to keep our dialogue locked into a mirror maze of bureaucratic technicalities – a proven diplomatic tactic for feigning a solutions-oriented attitude while preventing any meaningful progress. So, I ended up having a technical discussion with administrative officials from the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice on how best to ensure the most expedient transition for Assange to an acceptable prison routine that would allow him regular social contact and, most importantly, adequate access to his lawyers and case documents. I also emphasized that, based on our medical examinations, I was seriously concerned about Assange’s health and was of the opinion that he urgently needed access to an independent psychiatrist he could trust.

But my primary concern was the American extradition request. For almost a decade, the US Department of Justice had been preparing its case against Assange behind closed doors. Since 2010, there had been reports about secret hearings of a ‘Grand Jury’, a longstanding US judicial procedure extremely vulnerable to prosecutorial manipulation, in which a group of laypersons decides on whether to bring charges against an individual – without judicial guidance, based solely on evidence provided by the prosecutor, and under complete exclusion of both the public and the suspect himself. With more than 95 per cent of prosecutions in the US never being tried in court but ‘resolved’ through plea bargaining, the Grand Jury’s original purpose of protecting the public from governmental overreach has unfortunately been increasingly corrupted, transforming this once honourable institution into a convenient tool for shielding abuse of executive and prosecutorial power from judicial or public oversight.

In the case of Assange, the Grand Jury finally issued its first indictment on 6 March 2018, but it was kept secret – ‘sealed’ – until his arrest on 11 April 2019. Already the optics of that indictment were not credible. How likely was it, really, that the US Department of Justice would investigate against Assange for nine long years, only to come up with a single charge of ‘conspiracy to commit computer intrusion’ – an offence for which the maximum sentence was a paltry five years? A maximum sentence, moreover, which could only be applied in particularly serious cases, and would have to be significantly reduced in the case of Assange, as he was accused of a mere unsuccessful attempt causing no damage whatsoever. To any objective observer it was obvious that the US authorities had not investigated and surveilled Assange for almost a decade, and certainly would not conduct a full-blown extradition trial in the United Kingdom, simply to convict him of a petty offence punishable with a prison sentence of a few weeks at best.

A much more convincing explanation for this stunted indictment was that the US wanted to avoid officially charging Assange with espionage, at least for the time being. Espionage being the classic example of a political offence, any such charge would have blocked Assange’s extradition under Article 4 of the Anglo-American extradition treaty of 2003, which expressly prohibits extraditions for political offences. The computer intrusion charge was sufficient to satisfy the requirement of ‘dual criminality’, according to which no person can be extradited unless the alleged offence constitutes a crime in both countries. Furthermore, by restricting the charges to computer crimes, the US aimed to avoid a discussion about the implications of Assange’s indictment for press freedom. The official narrative being pushed here was that attempting to decode the password hash of a government computer, even if unsuccessful, was not a journalistic activity protected by the US Constitution, thus deflecting public attention from the dirty state secrets exposed by WikiLeaks. These were, of course, the real reason for Assange’s aggressive persecution.

There was one provision of the extradition treaty which I was particularly concerned about. According to the so-called ‘specialty principle’, the United States would only be able to prosecute Assange for offences for which his extradition had been requested and granted. On the face of it, this principle appeared to suggest that, once extradited, Assange could only be prosecuted for that single charge of ‘computer intrusion’, as set out in the indictment underlying the US-extradition request. But, as virtually always in law, there is a loophole. Thus, Article 18 provides that the extradited person may also be detained, tried or punished for ‘a differently denominated offence’, so long as it is based on the same facts as the offence on which extradition was granted. As I pointed out to my British interlocutors, the practical relevance of this provision could hardly be overstated. On this basis, even after Assange’s extradition from the United Kingdom, the United States could freely add new and different charges to its indictment against him, so long as they were supported by the facts described in the extradition request. This also explained why the description of facts in the extradition request was unusually broad and clearly exceeded what was required for a single count of computer intrusion. Of course, the addition of new charges would also open the door to more severe sanctions, possibly even the death penalty or a life sentence without parole. Neither would be compatible with British human rights obligations.

My interlocutors were visibly taken aback. They had not expected me to ask for their assessment of the human rights risks arising from the fine print of the Anglo-American extradition treaty. In a moment of carelessness, the official in charge of extradition policy exchanged a meaningful glance with his colleague responsible for international legal assistance. Then he cleared his throat and responded, his eyes firmly locked on the documents in front of him: ‘Well, yes … I suppose that is something we will have to look at if and when such a situation should arise.’ Sensing that I was going to insist on the point, his colleague quickly intervened: ‘I think we should now let the British judiciary do their work!’ Her decisive tone and facial expression made clear that this was the – non-negotiable – British proposal for a shared public position and that this was the end of our conversation.

In the morning of that same day, I had visited the offices of Doughty Street Chambers, a renowned law firm specializing in human rights, to meet with some of Assange’s lawyers, leading representatives of WikiLeaks, and a whole range of other witnesses. Among them was Stella Moris, who was introduced to me as a member of Assange’s legal team. At the time, the world was still unaware that she and Assange were secretly engaged and had even become parents, twice, during his stay at the embassy. I also met with Fidel Narváez, the former consul-general of the Ecuadorian embassy in London, and Guillaume Long, who had been Ecuador’s foreign minister until the election of President Lenín Moreno in 2017.

My two doctors had not yet finalized their medical report, and I knew that I would need time to triangulate and incorporate their findings with the evidence obtained from these witnesses, from the authorities, and from other sources into consolidated conclusions that I felt comfortable presenting both to the government and to the public. Nevertheless, we had of course already exchanged views and formed a preliminary opinion, which allowed us to compile a list of open questions to be further investigated. We all agreed that the physical and psychological symptoms shown by Assange constituted a normal response to prolonged isolation, stress, and anxiety. These symptoms included, most notably, early manifestations of neurological and cognitive impairment; restlessness and volatility; desperate attempts to suppress feelings of powerlessness; severe depression; and, underlying the rest, a permanent fear of being extradited to the United States and exposed to lifelong dehumanization in a Supermax prison. Assange suffered from severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the continuation and escalation of his cumulative stressors would very likely trigger a rapid deterioration of his health, and, in the worst case, a nervous breakdown, cardiac arrest, or even suicide. Without any doubt, Assange needed access to a trusted psychiatrist who was independent from the authorities. Ultimately, however, my task as the special rapporteur on torture was not to provide the authorities with a medical diagnosis, but to determine whether the diagnosed medical symptoms had been caused by torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, or whether other causes remained conceivable, such as pre-existing medical conditions or traumatic experiences not amounting to human rights violations.

#### Psychological Torture

My conclusion that Assange has been exposed to psychological torture has been repeatedly criticized, albeit not yet by anyone possessing the expertise and experience required to do so with a certain level of credibility. As far as I am aware, of all these critics, not one has personally examined Assange; none has any practical experience in identifying and documenting the traces of torture, or juridical expertise regarding contemporary forms of torture; and next to no one has bothered to actually read the official UN documents detailing my findings. Nevertheless, all kinds of self-appointed experts – from journalists to politicians and from functionaries to seasoned law professors – feel called upon to publicly attack my official conclusions as ‘absurd’, ‘nonsense’, and ‘wrong’, or as a ‘trivialization’ of the concept of torture. In the absence of the necessary professional competence, trumpeting such harsh criticism appears to be rather bold and, in many cases, outright embarrassing. While it says very little about the objectivity of my findings, it speaks volumes to the largely unconscious emotional strongholds of the predominant mindset against Assange.

I say this without assigning blame or ridicule. After all, in December 2018, I had reacted just as hastily and judgmentally to Assange’s first request for intervention. I had been deceived by the same relentless and perfidious smear campaign against him, which is still ongoing today and aims to deflect public attention away from what this case is really about. At the time, I would have fiercely rejected any suggestion that I had been deceived. But that is of course the whole point of deception – for once the deceived become aware of their deception, they are no longer deceived. So, in fact, my own cavalier attitude towards Assange was living proof that the deception was working. Even I, in my role as the officially appointed UN expert on the prohibition of torture, somehow ‘knew’ immediately that his case did not involve any real form of ill-treatment – at least as long as I managed to avoid looking at the facts. In order to bring some objectivity back into this discussion, we shall therefore take a quick look at the basic legal reasoning underlying my finding of psychological torture. The related factual evidence will only be summarized here, as it will be discussed at length in the following chapters.

The term ‘torture’ as defined in the UN Convention against Torture essentially refers to the intentional infliction of severe physical or mental pain or suffering in order to achieve a specific purpose. It is most commonly associated with the extraction or suppression of testimony or confessions, but can also involve other forms of coercion, intimidation, punishment or discrimination. Ultimately, torture always intends to break the will of the targeted person and to subjugate them to the will of the torturer. Importantly, the targeted persons – whose will the torturer intends to break – need not be only the immediate victims themselves, but can also be their husbands, wives, parents or children, their friends or associates, or even the general public. Also, torture is always directed against powerless individuals, who in the circumstances cannot do anything to resist or escape the infliction of pain or suffering.

The alternative term ‘other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’ – ‘ill-treatment’ for short – is used when the infliction of pain or suffering does not pursue a lawful purpose, or is unnecessary or disproportionate for the achievement of such a purpose, but lacks at least one of the characteristics of torture, namely intentionality, purposefulness, the intensity of the resulting suffering or the powerlessness of the victim. Examples of ill-treatment would include the negligent exposure of prisoners to inhumane conditions of detention without purposefully exploiting the resulting suffering; the disproportionate use of tear gas or physical violence against peaceful protesters; and humiliating, intimidating, or discriminatory statements or acts that cannot be justified but, in the circumstances, do not cause pain or suffering of sufficient intensity to achieve the purposes of torture.

From the perspective of international law, both torture and ill-treatment are subject to a universal, absolute prohibition and cannot therefore be justified under any circumstances. For torture, moreover, there is a worldwide treaty obligation to criminalize and prosecute, which reflects the special stigma attached to the cold-blooded instrumentalization of pain and suffering.

As I have pointed out in a dedicated report to the Human Rights Council in March 2020 (A/HRC/43/49), psychological torture differs from physical torture not in its purposes but in its methods. Whereas physical torture seeks to achieve its ends primarily through physical pain, psychological torture does so through the direct infliction of mental suffering; that is, without using the conduit of the physical body. In both cases, however, the ultimate goal is not the body, but the mind and emotions of the victim or the intimidated third party, which are to be broken and subjected to the torturer. In the long run, psychological torture causes not only mental pain or suffering, but also measurable physical harm, primarily through relentless over-stimulation and destabilization of the victim’s psycho-emotional balance. Strictly speaking, there really is no such thing as purely physical or purely psychological torture, and in most cases both forms of abuse are quite deliberately combined. Nevertheless, this distinction is useful in practice because physical and psychological torture methods cause different primary symptoms, the identification and documentation of which in turn requires different forensic examination methods.

In most cases, psychological torture focuses on the coordinated interaction of four elements: intimidation, isolation, arbitrariness, and humiliation. First, the torture victim’s need for security and protection is undermined by creating and sustaining a constant threat scenario, generating a profound sense of fear and intimidation. Second, the resulting anxiety is intensified by isolating the victim from their normal environment and social world and making them totally dependent on their torturers, even for the simplest and most intimate aspects of their daily life. Third, in order to further destabilize the victim, normal rules of social interaction are replaced by a deliberately arbitrary and confusing regime of ‘do’s’ and ‘don’ts’. Decisions are no longer made on the basis of clear and coherent criteria, but become increasingly erratic and unpredictable, exposing the victim to a growing sense of insecurity and helplessness. Finally, the torture victim’s sense of dignity and self-esteem is eroded through humiliation, shaming, and defamation. In the case of political dissidents especially, this also aims to destroy the victim’s public reputation and credibility, to make their persecution appear justified, and to render their return to their community difficult, if not impossible.

There could be no doubt that, during our visit to Belmarsh, Assange exhibited the medical symptoms typical of prolonged exposure to psychological torture. Several other medical doctors had earlier come to the same conclusion, when Assange was still confined at the Ecuadorian embassy. Given that a pre-existing mental condition could be ruled out as the cause of these symptoms, they had to be the result of external factors having impacted him over an extended period of time. In Assange’s case, these factors could be identified with a high degree of certainty and, cumulatively, created dynamics that can only be described as a concerted and sustained campaign of public mobbing.

As will be shown, Assange was deliberately demonized, humiliated and socially isolated shortly after the groundbreaking publication of the Afghan War Diary by WikiLeaks in July 2010. This was achieved primarily through the aggressive use by Swedish authorities of the mass media to disseminate rape allegations against Assange, in conjunction with extreme prosecutorial procrastination purposely perpetuating and instrumentalizing these allegations for almost a decade without any prospect of judicial resolution. Assange’s resulting vilification made it easy to pile on additional slander defaming him as a ruthless hacker, spy, and narcissist with blood on his hands. Meanwhile, in the background, the US government used their shadowy Grand Jury system to build up the threat scenario of a political trial followed by Assange’s burial alive in US solitary confinement – alarming enough for Assange to feel constantly threatened, yet secretive enough for his fears to be widely ridiculed as paranoia. In the following weeks and months, Assange gradually went from being hailed as a hero of press freedom to being despised as a tragicomic outcast, whose human rights and dignity no longer appeared to be a factor to be considered. Accordingly, his legitimate interests could now be openly trampled on without risking a public outcry or any form of accountability. With a predictability reminiscent of the witch trials of the seventeenth century, each official act or omission on the part of the public authorities made unmistakably clear that Assange could not rely on due process and would not be treated in accordance with the law in any of the involved jurisdictions. Thus, the basic elements of psychological torture were already in place: intimidation, isolation, arbitrariness and humiliation. But Assange was not yet completely defenceless. He still had an – albeit dwindling – circle of friends and supporters, he could still pursue his work and, crucially, at a time when all other doors had already closed against him, he still enjoyed the diplomatic protection of Ecuador – the one country that dared to step out of line.

Nonetheless, Assange’s situation became much more precarious when he fled to the Ecuadorian embassy in June 2012. Although he was temporarily protected from extradition to the United States, his freedom of movement was now limited to a few square metres. Then, five years later, the change of government in Ecuador abruptly turned Assange’s last refuge into an inescapable trap. The embassy turned into a hostile environment marked by overregulation, increasing isolation and constant surveillance. Visits from friends and supporters were made increasingly difficult, and his ability to communicate with the outside world was progressively restricted, culminating in the complete suppression of his internet access and phone communications shortly after the secret US indictment in March 2018. As will be shown, Assange’s isolation was deliberate, purposeful, and coordinated. His world became more and more confined until he was left with virtually no protected space and was rendered completely powerless against his continued mistreatment. Most importantly, however, with the change of government in Quito, the threat scenario of a potential extradition to the US had suddenly become very real again. This greatly increased the psychological pressure on Assange and generated a constant state of extreme anxiety and stress.

As if that were not enough, the public humiliation of Assange also intensified during that last phase at the embassy. From the dawn of history to contemporary ‘cancel culture’, public mobbing has been very effective at destroying people’s reputation, depriving them of their human dignity and excluding them from the group, often permanently. However, the methods have changed. Today, tarring and feathering has become superfluous; the exclusion and demonization is done by tweet, blog entry or scandalous headlines on the front pages. Over the years, Assange has been subjected to an unprecedented campaign of vilification, intimidation, humiliation and, ultimately, dehumanization. This has involved not only journalists, but also current and former politicians, and even officials directly occupied with processing and adjudicating his case. The spectrum of such statements ranges from ridicule and defamation all the way to open threats and calls for his murder.

For example, on 16 August 2012, the day Ecuador formally approved Assange’s asylum request, BBC reporter Thom Phipps recommended via Twitter that the Metropolitan Police ‘drag Assange out the embassy and shoot him in the back of the head in the middle of Trafalgar Square’. And Hillary Clinton, then US secretary of state, reportedly asked during a team meeting, ‘Can’t we just drone this guy?’ Significantly, when asked about the reported incident at a subsequent press conference, Clinton did not deny the alleged statement with the appropriate clarity, but merely claimed that she did not recall making such a ‘joke’. The casual attitude with which such disgraceful statements were shrugged off was not uncommon at the time. We shall return to this in more detail later. In any case, no government or media organization seemed to find it necessary to intervene and stop such incendiary pronouncements. Assange had become an outlaw.

It should come as no surprise that Assange’s prolonged exposure to such levels of intimidation, isolation, arbitrariness and humiliation has caused him to experience a progressively intensifying state of mental and emotional distress, anxiety and depression, which ended up exceeding the threshold of ‘severe pain or suffering’ associated with torture. For it to amount to psychological torture, such suffering must furthermore be inflicted intentionally and purposefully. While it is clear that isolated procedural mistakes or questionable judicial decisions generally cannot be equated with torture or ill-treatment, the following chapters will make just as clear that the gross arbitrariness and denial of justice experienced by Assange in all involved jurisdictions far exceed the imperfections which may occasionally arise in any due process proceeding. When a person’s fundamental rights are being systematically violated at every stage of every proceeding in every jurisdiction, and when such arbitrariness fails to trigger any effective corrective action for more than a decade, then the presumption of good faith on the part of the authorities simply cannot be upheld. In democracies governed by the rule of law, denial of justice on this scale cannot happen by accident or negligence, but only with intent. In international law, intent on the part of state officials exists regardless of criminal culpability, whenever it is reasonably foreseeable that their acts or omissions will, in fact, contribute to a human rights violation.

In terms of purpose, the public mistreatment of Assange is not about forcing a confession or otherwise coercing him to cooperate, but primarily serves to intimidate and deter other publishers, journalists, and whistleblowers who might be tempted to follow his example. In the absence of any evidence for a prosecutable crime, Assange’s persecution also aims to punish him arbitrarily – through intimidation, isolation, humiliation and endless proceedings – for having publicized the dirty secrets of the powerful. The public mobbing of defenceless individuals is one of the most primitive forms of social communication. Deeply rooted in the human subconscious since the dawn of history, it is a demonstration of power that requires no explanation and generally triggers instinctive behavioural patterns of self-protection, conformity and complicity. From the popular condemnation of Jesus Christ to the European witch trials of the seventeenth century and the political show trials of all dictatorships and sham democracies in human history, state-sanctioned mobbing has been one of the most effective methods of controlling public opinion and silencing inconvenient dissent.

When I informed Assange’s legal team that, in my official statements, I would be likely to speak not only of cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, but even of psychological torture, they were initially surprised. Not that they disagreed with my assessment, but they had not expected me to be willing to expose myself with such an unpopular view, in light of the overwhelming hostility of public opinion. They also seemed to be worried about my reputation and reminded me that, so far, no one in a position of influence who dared to speak up for Assange had escaped unharmed. Of course, they looked at the matter primarily from the perspective of their client’s interests. If I were to be ‘shot down’, Assange would lose an important advocate in his fight against extradition to the United States. Thus, they suggested that it might be preferable not to speak of ‘torture’ but only of ‘cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment’. Based on years of frustrating experience, they feared that allegations of torture would not be taken seriously and that a terminological compromise solution might be more promising than calling things by their name. It was then that I realized how fighting an uphill battle for years had worn down not only Assange, but even his lawyers. Systematic arbitrariness, rejection and ‘soft harassment’ on the part of the authorities, added to constant hostility on the part of the public, the press and even personal friends and acquaintances, had all contributed to what could be described as ‘vicarious trauma’.

But I was under no illusions that, after ten years of arbitrariness and persecution, the involved governments would be so swayed by terminological nuances as to suddenly comply with their human rights obligations towards Assange. If I was to retain my integrity and credibility, my reasoning had to be objective, coherent and convincing. Therefore, should my investigation lead to the conclusion that Assange had been exposed to psychological torture, then it was my duty to say so.

#### Reopening of the Swedish Investigation

Three days after my visit to London, on 13 May 2019, the Swedish Prosecution Authority announced the reopening of their preliminary investigation against Assange – for the third time since 2010. The official narrative had remained the same: Assange was suspected of rape. In all those years, however, the Swedish authorities had never been able to produce sufficient evidence to formally charge him of any criminal offence. Now, it seemed the prosecutor wanted to make a third attempt to finally get beyond the initial stage of a ‘preliminary investigation’. It had become somewhat of a race against time because, under Swedish law, the rape allegation would become time-barred in August 2020 – fifteen months later. A second allegation, regarding the sexual harassment of another woman, had already quietly expired in August 2015, also without sufficient evidence for a formal indictment.

At a press conference, the prosecutor explained her decision saying that Assange’s expulsion from the embassy had brought him once more within the reach of the Swedish authorities, and that his renewed interrogation was indispensable for a formal indictment for the alleged rape. Therefore, a new European Arrest Warrant would be requested for Assange, aiming to ensure his extradition to Sweden as soon as possible after completing his current prison sentence for bail violation in London.

During my conversation with Assange, I had hardly spoken about the Swedish investigation, as my focus had been on his current conditions of detention and the risks associated with his potential extradition to the United States. It was only the reopening of the preliminary investigation on 13 May that prompted me to look into the Swedish dimension of the case in more detail. My main concern was that the ‘rape suspect’ narrative could be used to facilitate his transfer to the United States via Sweden without the benefit of fair proceedings meeting the standards of due process. This scenario was by no means exaggerated. Already the ease with which the Swedish judiciary had upheld the previous arrest warrant against Assange did not bode well for a fair trial. For more than six years, the courts had consistently confirmed that Assange was suspected on ‘probable cause’ of rape, despite an obvious lack of prosecutable evidence as well as persistent procrastination and obstruction of the part of the prosecution. In conjunction with the customary secrecy with which criminal proceedings for sexual offences are conducted in Sweden, there really was no objectively verifiable safeguard against an arbitrary conviction based on flimsy evidence provided by a biased prosecutor behind closed doors.

In a next step, Assange would be sent to the United States, most likely through the mechanism of ‘temporary surrender’, a loophole in the US-Swedish extradition treaty permitting the United States to ‘borrow’ a suspect from Sweden for the purposes of criminal prosecution without full extradition proceedings. While such surrender must remain ‘temporary’, its duration is to be agreed by the two governments on a case-by-case basis – enough room for a tailor-made arrangement ensuring Assange’s permanent disappearance into the black hole of a US Supermax prison. The British, of course, would hasten to give their consent, never mind human rights and due process. For a convicted rapist, there would be no public outcry. Not in Britain, and certainly not in Sweden. Even influential human rights organizations would be wary of finding themselves on the wrong side of political correctness, especially in the eyes of their funders. It is not a coincidence, for example, that Amnesty International could not bring itself to recognize Assange as a ‘prisoner of conscience’ for more than a decade, in spite of the facts that he clearly fits the criteria for such designation, is persecuted for large-scale exposure of war crimes, torture and corruption, has previously received the Amnesty International Media Award, and risks spending the rest of his life in conditions of detention that can only be described as cruel, inhuman and degrading.

Assange was intelligent and realistic enough to know what awaited him in Sweden. He certainly did not choose to spend eighteen months in British house arrest followed by almost seven years inside the Ecuadorian embassy just to avoid a Swedish criminal trial which – in the worst of all cases – might entail a maximum sentence of four years in prison. He simply knew too much about the reality of international politics to believe that Swedish constitutional safeguards would be strong enough to protect him against the only serious danger to his life and dignity – his onward extradition to the United States.

That this danger was very real, despite Swedish claims to the contrary, is perhaps most poignantly illustrated by the shocking cases of Ahmed Agiza and Muhammad Al Zery, two Egyptian asylum seekers who had been officially registered in Sweden. On 18 December 2001, Agiza and Al Zery were arrested in Stockholm by the Swedish security police (Säpo) and handed over to CIA agents at Bromma Airport. From there, they were abducted to Egypt without any form of due process and tortured as suspected terrorists in the notorious Tora Prison. The Swedish authorities were later condemned in two separate proceedings, by the UN Human Rights Committee and the UN Committee against Torture, for a clear violation of the ‘non-refoulement’ principle derived from the prohibition of torture, and Sweden was ordered to pay damages of $500,000 to each of the victims. Despite obvious misconduct on the part of the Swedish authorities, the government refused to fully cooperate with the UN investigation as legally required and had to be explicitly reprimanded in this respect. The Swedish Parliament’s ombudsman for the judiciary subsequently criticized the responsible authorities ‘very seriously’ but, once more, the responsible authorities declined to initiate any criminal or disciplinary sanctions – in renewed violation of the Convention against Torture.

As evidenced by a long trail of internal correspondence and legal analyses of the Australian government, in the year 2011, even the foreign minister and other senior members of that government were seriously concerned that Sweden would use the mechanism of ‘temporary surrender’ to hand over Assange to the United States, in circumvention of regular extradition proceedings. Contrary to popular perception, therefore, the scenario most feared by Assange was not paranoid at all but – at least behind closed doors – perceived as a thoroughly realistic assessment, even in diplomatic circles of close US allies such as Australia.

#### US Indictment for Espionage

In 2019, however, the United States seemed to have changed their mind and decided to pursue Assange’s direct extradition from the United Kingdom. Since President Trump’s election, a different wind had been blowing across the Atlantic. Gone was the diplomatic façade of his predecessor, along with any more pretence of multilateral equality and cooperation. American foreign policy had become blunt, crude and erratic, while the British government had settled for an increasingly uncritical position of servility – the only part left for it to play in its ‘special relationship’ with the United States.

By reopening their investigation on 13 May 2019, Sweden now inadvertently challenged the United States. Suddenly, there could be two competing extradition requests. Which one would have priority? According to the Anglo-American extradition treaty, priority among competing requests would depend, among other things, on the seriousness of the alleged crime and on the temporal order in which the requests had been made. On both counts, a Swedish request would probably have to be prioritized. Sweden’s first extradition request in the same matter dated back to November 2010 and, by June 2012, it had been successfully litigated all the way through to the British Supreme Court. Moreover, the ‘less serious’ form of rape Assange was suspected of in Sweden carried a maximum sentence of four years in prison. While this was less than the maximum of five years applicable to the single count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion of the US indictment, the probable sanction for the alleged unsuccessful attempt to commit such intrusion was significantly lower than that likely to be imposed in the case of a rape conviction in Sweden.

It took the United States just ten days to put their heavy foot down. On 23 May 2019, still within the sixty-five-day deadline for completing their extradition request, the US Department of Justice transmitted its first ‘superseding indictment’, extending their list of charges by seventeen additional counts under the Espionage Act of 1917. From now on, the US case against Assange was no longer about some failed attempt to decode a password hash, but plainly and blatantly about espionage – the classic textbook example of a political offence. Moreover, since all seventeen new charges accused Assange of obtaining, receiving or disclosing national defence information, it was also clear that the indictment constituted a frontal attack on press freedom as guaranteed in the US Constitution. For each count, Assange now faced an additional sentence of up to ten years in prison, resulting in a possible prison sentence of up to 175 years. The disparity with the Swedish maximum sentence of four years was now so great, and the US claim to priority had been so unequivocally stated, that a possible Swedish extradition request would necessarily have to come second. It little mattered that 175 years in prison would be a grotesque sanction for alleged offences involving neither death nor violence, injury or material harm. By way of comparison, in 2010 the UN Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia sentenced two former Serbian military officers to life in prison for their role in the 1995 genocide of 7,000 Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica. Still, after thirty years, both would be eligible for early release. Conversely, once in a US Supermax prison, Assange would almost certainly die there with no opportunity for early release.

Moreover, the now eighteen charges might not be the last word, as the expanded description of facts could serve as a basis for adding further, even more serious charges. All that needed to happen in order for this scenario to materialize was that the competent US court – the notorious ‘Espionage Court’ in Alexandria, Virginia – should come to a different conclusion than the US Department of Justice as to which crimes may have been committed in the present case. Depending on which offence was added, even the death penalty would become conceivable, although it could not be lawfully carried out due to restrictions imposed by the Anglo-American extradition treaty. In the worst case, therefore, Assange would spend the rest of his life on death row, either in complete isolation or surrounded by other death row inmates and without any hope of release.

Against this background, it is no mystery why the description of facts underlying the first superseding indictment of 23 May 2019 was broadly framed and only partially relevant to the eighteen counts of the indictment, and why the alleged facts were once more significantly expanded more than a year later, in the second superseding indictment of 24 June 2020. This suggests that, in the event of Assange’s extradition and trial in the United States, the US Department of Justice intends to further expand its indictment. The current charges focus on criminalizing the obtention, reception and disclosure of national defence information, all of which are standard journalistic activities. The indictment is therefore vulnerable to counterarguments based on constitutional press freedoms that may well prevail before the US Supreme Court. In order to ensure that Assange would be silenced behind bars for the rest of his life, the government therefore had an interest in providing the trial judge with broad factual allegations permitting the identification of additional offences unrelated to press freedom protections – such as computer crimes and endangering life and property.

It is noteworthy that the US indictment focuses exclusively on conduct that is alleged to have occurred in 2010 – as if there had been no WikiLeaks publications before or after. In fact, Assange had continued his work with WikiLeaks even from the Ecuadorian embassy, at least until March 2018, when his ability to communicate was effectively suppressed after the change of government in Ecuador and the secret US indictment. Most of these activities do not appear to be fundamentally different from those described in the US indictment or to pose a lesser threat to official secrecy and impunity.

The decisive difference seems to be that, for the WikiLeaks revelations of 2010, the US Department of Justice possesses actual correspondence between Assange and his source inside the US military – Chelsea Manning – who had indisputably violated her own duty of non-disclosure and thus made herself liable to prosecution under US criminal law. Only this correspondence enabled the US government to charge Assange with conspiring to commit a crime: that of Manning. In most other cases, there is no evidence of direct contact with the source. Assange himself has often emphasized that WikiLeaks does not know its own sources and that the documents are transmitted anonymously. This makes criminal prosecution of WikiLeaks personnel virtually impossible, because the mere publication of classified information has long been recognized as a journalistic activity protected by international and constitutional press freedom guarantees.

Accurately understood, therefore, Assange is charged with assisting Manning in violating her own duty of non-disclosure and inciting her to deliver further classified documents. At first glance, even this reads like the job description of any moderately motivated journalist. Should we not expect of investigative journalists to enquire exactly what information a source has to offer, to dig deeper wherever possible, and to not be satisfied too quickly?

Admittedly it may not be part of a journalist’s job to help his source crack a password hash, as Assange allegedly attempted to do, even for the purpose of source protection. But then, even if this allegation were true, all it refers to is an unsuccessful attempt. As is well known, every single day, millions of attempts are made to decode sensitive passwords or password components on government computers throughout the world. In the vast majority of cases, these attempts fail or otherwise remain harmless, just like the one Assange is alleged to have been involved in. But no government spends millions of dollars on surveillance and extradition proceedings for more than a decade simply to investigate and prosecute a single inconsequential conspiracy like the one alleged in the US indictment against Assange. Provided such isolated attempts are not carried out, are unsuccessful or otherwise remain harmless, they are generally regarded as petty offences that are not worth prosecuting. In Assange’s case, however, the US Department of Justice was desperate to find a pretext for his prosecution. The problem was not Assange’s alleged conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, of course, but that he had exposed war crimes and other dirty secrets, creating transparency in places where the powerful wanted nothing but obscurity. Unlike the whistleblower Manning, however, Assange’s journalistic activities were protected by press freedom and could not be prosecuted. At least, this seemed to be the view taken by the Obama administration.

The Trump administration’s superseding indictment of 23 May 2019 performed a dramatic U-turn and, for the first time since the Pentagon Papers scandal of the 1970s, tried once more to use the Espionage Act to criminalize and suppress journalistic publications. At the time of the Pentagon Papers, the Nixon administration had obtained a federal court injunction preventing the *New York Times* from publishing secret documents proving that the US government had deliberately deceived the American public and Congress about, among other things, its illegal expansion of the Vietnam War into neighbouring Cambodia and Laos. The injunction was ultimately overruled by the Supreme Court. In its landmark decision of 30 June 1971, the court held that: ‘Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government. And paramount among the responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people and sending them off to distant lands to die of foreign fevers and foreign shot and shell.’ The court’s lifting of the publication ban set a precedent that would protect the free press from a power-hungry executive for exactly five decades. With its indictment of Assange for espionage, the US government was once again using its criminal justice system in an bid to silence a publisher for exposing its secrets. At the same time, by threatening a maximum sanction of 175 years of imprisonment, the US government had forcefully asserted priority for its own extradition request over any competing Swedish interests – ‘America first!’

#### Medically Prescribed Solitary Confinement

Already during my prison visit in Belmarsh, Assange’s health gave rise to serious concern, and we warned the authorities that, unless urgent safeguards were put in place, his medical condition was likely to deteriorate rapidly. Little did I know how quickly our fears would become a reality. Just nine days after my visit, on 18 May 2019, Assange was permanently transferred to Belmarsh’s health care unit. In addition to significant weight loss, his mental health had reportedly deteriorated to the point where he could no longer attend court hearings and had to be stabilized with medication – the tragic but predictable medical culmination of years of relentless psychological trauma. At the health care unit, Assange initially shared a cell with three other inmates, but was transferred to a single cell soon thereafter, where he would be held from June 2019 to January 2020 in conditions de facto amounting to solitary confinement: locked in his cell for twenty-three hours a day, under permanent video surveillance due to an alleged suicide risk, and without any contact with other inmates.

According to the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, known as the ‘Mandela Rules’, solitary confinement refers to any confinement of a prisoner without meaningful human contact for twenty-two or more hours a day. The Mandela Rules state that solitary confinement may be used only in exceptional cases and as a last resort, for as short a time as possible, and subject to independent review. Moreover, again according to the Mandela Rules, solitary confinement should be prohibited whenever its use would exacerbate a prisoner’s mental or physical condition, and any prolonged solitary confinement for more than fifteen consecutive days would violate the absolute prohibition of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment under international law. Such are the international minimum standards of humane treatment applying to all and any persons deprived of their liberty throughout the world. For Assange, however, this form of ill-treatment very quickly became the status quo.

From a legal perspective, there can be absolutely no justification for imposing any form of detention amounting to prolonged solitary confinement on a non-violent inmate posing no threat to anyone. In the case of Assange, it is difficult to escape the impression that the necessary medical measures were used as a welcome pretext to isolate him. Whatever the situation, the prison administration always had a handy excuse. When Assange’s health stabilized, any progress was said to confirm the positive medical effect of his isolation, which therefore had to be extended. Conversely, whenever his health deteriorated, his isolation and constant surveillance had to be extended for his own protection. A torturous Catch-22 was underway by which Assange’s silencing and abuse could be perpetuated indefinitely, all under the guise of concern for his health.

To make matters worse, throughout his detention in Belmarsh Assange was denied meaningful access to his court documents, his meetings with lawyers and independent medical doctors were severely restricted and systematically obstructed, and external visits from family and friends were kept to a minimum – all under the convenient pretext of bureaucratic constraints. Thus, Assange was deliberately prevented from adequately preparing for his upcoming court proceedings in multiple jurisdictions, above all for the complex US extradition trial. Although this situation evidently constituted a grave and sustained violation of Assange’s most basic rights as a defendant, all complaints by his legal team were shrugged off by the responsible judge. In her view, the responsibility for Assange’s conditions of detention lay exclusively with the prison administration and therefore beyond her jurisdiction. What she failed to explain, however, was how this was compatible with her duty to ensure that any trial in her courtroom would be conducted in full compliance with fundamental procedural guarantees, including the defendant’s right to adequately prepare his defence.
