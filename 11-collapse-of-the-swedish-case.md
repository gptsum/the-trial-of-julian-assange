### Chapter 11: Collapse of the Swedish Case

#### Headwind from America

Only four days after I had visited Assange in Belmarsh, on 13 May 2019, the Swedish Prosecution Authority reopened its preliminary investigation against him – by now for the third time. Almost nine years had passed since his visit to Sweden, since that fateful day in August 2010 when the two Swedish women visited Klara police station in Stockholm and the Swedish authorities zealously presented Assange to the world as a rape suspect – thus successfully thwarting the imminent establishment of WikiLeaks as a constitutionally protected press organization in Sweden. Since then, Swedish investigators had formally interviewed Assange twice, had heard numerous witnesses and had carried out exhaustive DNA analyses. However, given the persistent lack of prosecutable evidence, the investigation had already been discontinued twice, without Assange ever being formally charged with an offence. Now, the Swedish Prosecution Authority seemed bent on adding a third round to the procedural fiasco of its longest-ever ‘preliminary investigation’.

In all these years, no significant progress had been made, but the investigation had been deliberately prevented from progressing beyond the preliminary stage. This was particularly convenient because, in the absence of a formal indictment, the Swedish authorities could continue to publicly portray Assange as a ‘rape suspect’ without having to disclose their evidence and subject their allegations to judicial review. By May 2019, the allegations in the case of A. had been time-barred almost four years, and the case of S. would expire in fifteen months, in August 2020. Ultimately, the strategy of systematic procrastination on the part of the Swedish Prosecution Authority would deprive not only Assange, but also the two women of any chance to receive justice and redress. But that did not seem to bother the Swedish authorities. They had never shown any genuine interest in prosecuting Assange for sexual offences which they knew could not be proved in court. Instead, these allegations were artificially kept alive for the purpose of Assange’s political persecution – not officially, of course, but as part of their ‘informal’, ‘strong’ and ‘reliable’ intelligence cooperation with their transatlantic partner. But that was not something the Swedish people and its Parliament needed to know. Their interference would only have ‘jeopardized’ these ‘successful arrangements’ between the intelligence services of Sweden and the United States.

For the Swedish Prosecution Authority, allowing their preliminary investigation in the cases of A. and S. to become time-barred without formal indictment was particularly advantageous. This meant that the case was formally closed and all the evidence – or the lack thereof – sealed, archived and withdrawn from public scrutiny. At the same time, the rape suspect narrative could be perpetuated indefinitely without ever coming before a court. Publicly, this deliberately manufactured outcome could conveniently be blamed on Assange, by accusing him of having evaded justice. The same narrative had been used already in August 2015, when the prosecutor allowed the case of A. to become time-barred, even though she had been in the possession of all the elements required to decide on a formal indictment of Assange since at least July 2011.

On 12 April 2019, one day after Assange’s arrest and more than a month before Sweden resurrected its preliminary investigation in the case of S. for the third time, no less than seventy British MPs sent an open letter to Prime Minister Theresa May. They demanded that, in the event of competition between a possible Swedish extradition request and the one already made by the United States, Assange should be extradited to Sweden. ‘We must send a strong message of the priority the UK has in tackling sexual violence and the seriousness with which such allegations are viewed’, the letter stated.

The hypocrisy of these assertions was revealed when, in the same year, Prince Andrew, the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth II, was suspected in the United States of repeated sexual abuse of a minor as part of the Geoffrey Epstein affair. The US Department of Justice made a formal request to interview the prince as part of its investigation, but His Royal Highness declined. This time, curiously, those same MPs were not moved to send an open letter to the Prime Minister demanding that the prince be handed over to the United States. Forgotten was the need to ‘send a strong message of the priority the UK has in tackling sexual violence and the seriousness with which such allegations are viewed’.

In all likelihood, more than anything else, the open letter advocating Assange’s extradition to Sweden was designed to woo British voters ahead of the upcoming general election of December 2019. The British people strongly disliked the Anglo-American extradition treaty of 2003, a lopsided agreement that was perceived as being highly unfavourable to the United Kingdom due to Tony Blair’s subservient interpretation of Britain’s ‘special relationship’ with the United States. By giving preference to the Swedish extradition request, criticism of British servility towards the United States could be deflated. At the same time, parliamentarians could take a strong public stance against sexual violence without having to lift a finger to improve the notoriously low prosecution and conviction rates for reported sexual offences within the UK. Last but not least, by sending Assange to Sweden, Britain could avoid dealing with the political pressures resulting from the US extradition request and pass the problem on to Sweden.

As patently demonstrated by the British Supreme Court’s extradition decision in 2012, however, British realpolitik has long ceased to consider the opinion of Parliament. For years, the United States had regarded the Swedish rape narrative against Assange as a welcome distraction from the war crimes and corruption revealed by WikiLeaks. But now, after the DNC Leaks, US intelligence agencies had managed to portray Assange as the scapegoat for Donald Trump’s election victory in 2016, an event that had traumatized very influential segments of the American public. The Swedish ‘rape narrative’ was no longer needed, because, by and large, the American public had taken the bait and was unlikely to find out about the true purpose of Assange’s prosecution in time to prevent the criminalization of investigative national security journalism.

Thus, ten days after the official reopening of the Swedish preliminary investigation into the case of S., the US government doubled down. With the superseding indictment of 23 May 2019, the United States expanded their original indictment on a single charge of ‘conspiracy to commit computer intrusion’ by seventeen additional counts under the Espionage Act and – crucially – increased the maximum sentence from five to 175 years in prison. Compared to a potentially competing Swedish extradition request for (‘lesser degree’) rape, which carried a maximum custodial sentence of four years, the US request would certainly take precedence.

#### Headwind from London

In Sweden, Marianne Ny had retired from public service and Deputy Director of Public Prosecution Eva-Marie Persson was now in charge of the case. On 20 May 2019, Persson issued a press release announcing that she had applied to Uppsala District Court for a detention order against Assange, based on which she planned to issue a new European Arrest Warrant and obtain his surrender to Sweden. Because – of course – it was still necessary to question Assange in Sweden. On the same day, the Swedish Prosecution Authority also reached out to their British counterpart ‘to make clear that the (possible) EAW also includes a request for the temporary surrender’. Persson had probably expected the Crown Prosecution Service to meet her with the same unconditional complicity that Marianne Ny had enjoyed for years. But Paul Close, the man formerly in charge in London, had retired too, and British legislation had since been amended to reflect the proportionality concerns raised by the Supreme Court in Assange’s first Swedish extradition trial in 2012.

Most importantly, however, the United States had now openly stepped into the ring with an extradition request of its own and, therefore, no longer depended on its ‘reliable partner’ Sweden for the execution of its policies. Alison Riley, Specialist Extradition Prosecutor at the CPS, initially responded that extending the European Arrest Warrant to a temporary surrender ‘would not be a problem’. But twenty-four hours later, on 21 May, the tone had changed. Presumably, the imminent prospect of a competing extradition request for Assange from Sweden had triggered consultations at the political level.

Now, Prosecutor Riley suddenly confronted the Swedes with far-reaching questions and categorial terms: ‘Can you explain why it is still necessary to interview [Julian Assange]? You will be aware of the new section 12A of our law which makes it imperative that there is a decision to charge and try a Requested Person in the Requesting State before an EAW can succeed. If there is any suggestion that those decisions have not been made, or that [Julian Assange] cannot be brought to trial unless he is first interviewed, the Court will not order his surrender.’ In short, the harsh message coming from London was that Assange would not be surrendered to Sweden unless it was already decided that he would be formally charged and tried for a criminal offence there. That was a remarkable shift from 2012, when Britain’s Supreme Court had bent over backwards and ignored the will of Parliament in order to allow Assange’s forcible surrender to Sweden for the mere purpose of an interview in a preliminary investigation.

After almost nine years of comfortable tailwind from London, the Swedish Prosecution Authority was suddenly faced with the requirements of due process and the rule of law. Eva-Marie Persson knew, of course, that she had no chance of successfully prosecuting Assange. She did not even have enough probative elements to back up a formal indictment. There simply was no prosecutable evidence demonstrating Assange’s culpability for any offence beyond reasonable doubt. As internal correspondence at the Swedish Prosecution Authority shows, Persson therefore looked for alternatives to his formal extradition. Either Assange could again be questioned in London or – and this was her preferred option – the European Arrest Warrant, which she firmly expected to be issued, could be used to temporarily ‘borrow’ Assange from Britain through the mechanism of temporary surrender. By proposing this possibility to the British authorities in writing, the Swedish Prosecution Authority explicitly confirmed Sweden’s willingness – always feared by Assange and always denied by the government – to circumvent the legal hurdles of formal extradition procedures with the instrument of temporary surrender. Nonetheless, Persson was grappling with what seemed to be British obstruction.

On 21 May 2019, she wrote in an email to a subordinate staff member: ‘We have tried to find avenues for the United Kingdom to meet both the wishes of the United States and those of Sweden. But this correspondence [with Alison Riley] seems to indicate that there is no interest in doing so in the UK.’ What ‘avenues’ was Persson talking about here? Was this about Assange’s temporary surrender from Britain to Sweden and – given that the same mechanism was foreseen in the US-Swedish extradition treaty – subsequently to the United States? Be this as it may, with its superseding indictment of 23 May 2019 the US government signalled that they were no longer keen or even willing to take the detour via Sweden. They wanted Assange’s direct extradition to the United States.

#### Headwind from Sweden

But the Swedish Prosecution Authority also faced unexpected headwinds at home. In order to issue a new EAW, Persson had first to obtain a detention order from Uppsala District Court. On Tuesday, 28 May 2019, two and a half weeks after my prison visit to Belmarsh, I had transmitted my first official letter to the Swedish government, expressing my concern about the alleged complicity of Swedish authorities in the persecution and mistreatment of Assange. On Friday of the same week, 31 May 2019, I released my press statement, temporarily waking even the mainstream press from its lethargy about Assange’s human rights. On the following Monday, 3 June 2019, the Uppsala District Court refused to issue a detention order against Assange, on grounds of proportionality. According to the court, Assange was now serving a sentence in a British prison, so it was possible and acceptable for a Swedish prosecutor conducting a preliminary investigation to interview him in London in line with applicable international mutual legal assistance agreements. If and when the prosecutor reached the conclusion that Assange should be formally charged of a criminal offence, his extradition could then still be sought for the purpose of holding the trial.

Of course, for the past nine years, there had never been any legal or practical obstacle to questioning Assange in London. Thus, the exact same considerations of proportionality should already have prevented the initial Swedish detention order and related EAW against him in November 2010. So how come, after almost a decade, the Swedish judiciary suddenly decided to start treating Assange in accordance with the law?

It is probably not too far-fetched to make a causal connection between the decision of the Uppsala District Court and my strong official statements a few days earlier. Like any other officials, judges do not want to end up on the wrong side of history. By deciding not to issue a detention order and to avoid an extradition request for the time being, the Swedish judiciary gained time. They could now wait and see whether the noise created by this UN special rapporteur would be loud enough to trigger a parliamentary investigation in Sweden, or whether it would turn out to be a storm in a teacup they could safely ignore. For once, official self-interest seemed to work in Assange’s favour, at least temporarily. However, for the investigation to be dropped altogether, a final element was still missing.

#### The Day of Truth

When on 12 July 2019 I received the evasive reply of the Swedish government to my official letter of 28 May, it was immediately clear to me that I was not going to take ‘no’ for an answer. Too much evidence had piled up for me to be able to sweep the emerging picture of massive judicial arbitrariness under the carpet and continue business as usual.

Instead, I drafted a follow-up letter, which was transmitted to the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 12 September 2019 and made abundantly clear that I would not be fobbed off with platitudes. Whereas in my first letter I had asked only five questions, my second letter contained fifty. I confronted the government with a detailed catalogue of perceived due process violations and other inconsistencies and asked them to ‘explain, point by point and in detail, the compatibility of each of [these] acts and omissions of the Swedish authorities … and of the overall impact of the Swedish investigation on the rights and reputation of Mr. Assange, with Sweden’s international human rights obligations, in particular with the presumption of innocence and with the principles of legality, impartiality, necessity, proportionality, efficacy and good faith, all of which are intrinsic due process requirements indispensable to justice and the rule of law.’ As usual, the Swedish authorities were given sixty days to respond. Their reply arrived on 11 November 2019, the very last day of that deadline. It consisted of three meagre sentences, acknowledging the receipt of my letter and informing me tersely: ‘In relation to the communication of 12 September 2019, I would like to refer to the Government’s response of 12 July 2019. The Government has no further observations to make.’

In essence, of course, their initial response of 12 July 2019 had already made clear that the Swedish government had ‘no further observations to make’ – just more verbosely and with fourfold reference to the independence of the Swedish judiciary. Despite the Swedish government’s demonstrative termination of any dialogue on this case, my follow-up letter seems to have had a quite substantial effect behind the scenes: a few days later, on 19 November 2019, the preliminary investigation into the case of S. was formally discontinued for the third and final time.

In her decision, Prosecutor Persson emphasized that S. ‘has submitted a credible and reliable version of events. Her statements have been coherent, extensive and detailed.’ However, she explained that ‘support for the injured party’s assertion – and therefore of the alleged criminal act is now deemed to have weakened, largely due to the long period of time that has elapsed since the events in question.’ In the prosecutor’s overall assessment, ‘the evidential situation has been weakened to such an extent that that there is no longer any reason to continue the preliminary investigation. It cannot be assumed that further inquiries will change the evidential situation in any significant manner. The preliminary investigation is therefore discontinued.’

In reality, of course, there had never been any prosecutable evidence other than S.’s testimony. If the prosecutor still considered her testimony to be ‘credible and reliable’, then it was difficult to comprehend how its probative value could have so dramatically diminished over time. As a matter of logic, the only conceivable explanation for affirming the credibility and reliability of S.’s testimony while at the same time dismissing the credibility and reliability of the official rape narrative was that one had nothing to do with the other. This left two possibilities. The first was that, contrary to the police report based on her statement, S. herself had never alleged to have been raped, and that Prosecutor Persson had come to the same conclusion as her colleague Eva Finné nine years earlier, namely that S.’s testimony was credible but did not give rise to any suspicion of criminal conduct. The second possibility was that the facts alleged by S. constituted rape while the facts alleged by Assange did not, and that, all other evidentiary factors being equal, the suspect had to be given the benefit of the doubt – *in dubio pro reo*. In both cases, irrespective of what had really happened between S. and Assange, he had to be considered innocent as a matter of law.

Of course, all of this had been known to the Swedish authorities already in September 2010. But, even now, the prosecutor could not bring herself to say any of this. Not a word about the presumption of innocence. Not a word of regret for the almost ten years of judicial arbitrariness at the expense of all three persons concerned: Assange and the two women. No redress for the reputational harm and the hostility, humiliation and mistreatment they suffered. No compensation for Assange’s nearly ten years of arbitrary detention solely due to untenable allegations of rape irresponsibly disseminated and perpetuated by the Swedish authorities. At the press conference, Persson was asked whether she regretted the way the investigation had been handled. Once more, the absence of a firm denial was more revealing than the evasive content of the reply. She could only take personal responsibility for the last six months, Persson said, and during this time she had tried to conduct the investigation as quickly and quality-oriented as possible. However, she could not comment on what had happened under the responsibility of another investigator. It was possible that the Prosecution Authority would have to ‘look into this question once all of this is over’. To date, this appears to be the closest the Swedish authorities have ever come to a critical self-examination in this case.

Since the sudden invocation of due process and the rule of law by their British counterparts and the District Court of Uppsala, the Swedish Prosecution Authority had acted like a deer caught in the headlights. Desperately scrambling for new investigative measures that could be taken to maintain a façade of credibility, they saw the prospect and rationale of their case against Assange dwindle rapidly towards total collapse. Prosecutor Persson’s internal directives issued during the summer of 2019 reveal the extent to which the Swedish investigation was in disarray and lacked even the most basic foundations of a prosecutable case. In her directive of 13 June, Persson writes: ‘We need to make a preliminary assessment of the evidence.’ Preliminary? Seriously? After nine years? How does the need for a ‘preliminary assessment’ chime with the publicly proclaimed, supposedly consolidated suspicion on probable cause? But Persson continues: ‘It is not appropriate for us to request permission to interview [Assange] in England if we do not consider that we have sufficiently strong evidence.’ This statement is quite revealing given that, in practice, even the flimsiest level of evidence is sufficient to justify interviewing a suspect. In another directive of 26 July, referring to various pieces of evidence, Persson writes: ‘I’ll have to read through them all and decide how strong the support for the alleged crime *really* is’ [emphasis in original]. Really? How come it took the prosecutor nine years to ask the right question? According to Persson, by July 2019, ‘the oral evidence in support of the alleged offence has deteriorated’ – as if the original statements from 2010 could no longer be used as evidence. ‘If the memory and/or willingness to contribute of [witness X.] has deteriorated in the same way as several other witnesses, I think that will be the nail in the coffin.’

My follow-up letter to the government is probably what became the final ‘nail in the coffin’ of the Swedish case. I had listed fifty perceived due process violations, some of them serious, and had asked fifty questions that the authorities quite evidently preferred to leave unanswered. After only two months, these fifty allegations and questions would be published on the website of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. This entailed a considerable risk of uncomfortable questions being asked by the press, in parliament, by an ombudsman, or by a court about the legal responsibilities arising in this case.

While it would have been more elegant to maintain the preliminary investigation in a state of undead paralysis until the case of S. became time-barred in August 2020, its immediate discontinuation was clearly the safer solution, because it put a formal end to the matter for everyone involved. This was a final nod to the fact that the Swedish Prosecution Authority had never really pursued justice and the rule of law in this case – neither for Assange nor for the two women. All three had been instrumentalized and abused by the authorities for the purpose of political persecution and deterrence. Even if, ultimately, the collapse of the Swedish case against Assange had been inevitable, it left a bitter aftertaste.
