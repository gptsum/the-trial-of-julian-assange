### Chapter 5: Crossing the Rubicon

#### Preliminary Observations

By the end of May 2019, the time had come for me to present my preliminary observations and recommendations in the case. Originally, I had intended to address my official letter only to the British government, which currently had Assange in its custody. However, my inquiry had revealed that at least four states had actively contributed to Assange’s persecution and were legally co-responsible for causing his current situation: the United Kingdom, Sweden, Ecuador, and the United States. I therefore decided to write separate letters to all four states, in order to transmit my findings, request explanations and make recommendations.

By mid-May, I had already completed first drafts, but new information kept arriving almost every day, which needed to be cross-checked and then integrated or discarded. In addition, translation errors, contradictions and other inaccuracies came to light, which required further inquiry, corrections or amendments. Also, the medical report, whose final version had been co-authored by Professor Vieira and Dr Pérez-Sales, had to be incorporated in such a way that while the doctor–patient confidentiality of the diagnosis was preserved, it could still serve as an objective medical basis for my legal findings. In addition, the Secretariat of the High Commissioner’s Office kept raising questions of protocol and procedure which had to be duly taken into account.

Over the past decade, a veritable mountain of evidentiary material had accumulated in multiple languages, including judicial and administrative decisions, investigative files, official and unofficial correspondence, emails and text messages, testimonies by medical doctors, legal experts, and other witnesses, as well as countless press reports promoting various contradicting narratives. Clearly, this material could not be comprehensively addressed within the limited form and space of official letters to the responsible governments. But then, my role was not that of an investigative judge or prosecutor expected to submit unassailable courtroom evidence. As the UN special rapporteur, my mandate was to alert states to possible violations of the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment, to seek to clarify these allegations, and to remind governments of their international legal obligations to prevent, investigate, punish and redress such crimes. As a matter of treaty law, the governments concerned had to act ex officio to launch a prompt and impartial investigation, as soon as they had ‘reasonable grounds to believe’ that an act of torture or ill-treatment may have been committed or contributed to by persons acting within their jurisdiction. Given that my findings were based on a personal prison visit, numerous witness statements and a specialized medical examination, the ‘reasonable grounds’ threshold clearly had not only been met, but far exceeded. It was therefore sufficient for my letters to summarize my preliminary observations, make further inquiries and recommend urgent measures.

My aim was to provide the involved governments with a clear and coherent description of how their alleged acts and omissions had contributed to Assange’s psychological torture and why his extradition to the United States would be incompatible with the UN Convention against Torture. My letter started out with a general assessment of Assange’s current conditions of detention and expressed my alarm at his deteriorating state of health. It then established the causal link between Assange’s current medical symptoms and the treatment and conditions to which he had previously been subjected: years of arbitrary confinement, surveillance and harassment in the Ecuadorian embassy; the abuse of Swedish investigative and judicial proceedings for the purpose of political persecution; and his sustained and unrestrained public mobbing, intimidation and defamation by authorities, political leaders and the press. I therefore called on each government to investigate its own contribution to Assange’s abuse and to ensure the compensation and redress of any harm unjustly inflicted on him.

But dealing with past misconduct alone was not enough. If extradited to the United States, whether directly from Britain or indirectly via Sweden, Assange would almost certainly face an unfair trial, as well as a draconian sanction and conditions of detention which could only be described as cruel, inhuman and degrading. In light of this risk, Assange’s extradition would be absolutely prohibited under the principle of ‘non-refoulement’ enshrined in Article 3 of the UN Convention against Torture. However, even the strictest extradition ban can only be effective when it is actually enforced, in a fair and transparent extradition trial. All of the previous and ongoing British judicial proceedings against Assange strongly suggested that the United Kingdom could not be relied upon in this regard.

The wording of my letter may have been unusually harsh and uncompromising, but not without good reason. By now, the Assange case had been dragging on for more than nine years, during which the involved governments had repeatedly acted in bad faith and blatant violation of both international and domestic law. I certainly did not want to find myself in the same situation as the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention a few years earlier, when their expert opinion in the Assange case was self-righteously ignored by both Sweden and the United Kingdom, simply because it confirmed the unlawfulness of Assange’s continued siege in the Ecuadorian embassy. So far, all of the evidence I had seen strongly suggested that Assange’s deteriorating state of health was not the result of an unintended chain of unfortunate circumstances, but of deliberate collusion for the systematic persecution, silencing and destruction of an inconvenient political dissident.

I knew that, if I wanted my findings to be taken seriously and to receive more than just a few evasive platitudes in response, a diplomatic expression of concern would not be sufficient. Instead, I had to sound the alarm, alert the public and send an unmistakable message to the responsible states: Get your act together! You may have legitimate concerns about the activities of Assange and WikiLeaks and, if you have evidence for criminal conduct, then by all means hold him accountable. But all of this needs to be done in fair and transparent proceedings governed by the law, and must not be misused for political purposes. The persecution of Assange must end here and now!

I wrote in the hope that, by being so blunt, I would rock the boat sufficiently to achieve some results. Sweden had just reopened its preliminary investigation against Assange, but had not yet requested his extradition from Britain, and the US extradition proceedings had not yet begun. Perhaps, I thought, there was still time to turn this ship around. Perhaps the involved governments would want to avoid too much dirt being dug up and might prefer to find a face-saving way out. Like in the case of Augusto Pinochet, the British government could decline to extradite Assange on medical grounds, or the British courts could come to the same conclusion, in both cases without having to adjudicate the legal admissibility or extraditability of the US espionage charges. In such a ‘pre-cooked’ scenario agreed by all involved governments, Assange could be repatriated on humanitarian grounds to Australia, London could point to ‘medical imperatives’ or, respectively, to the ‘independence of the judiciary’, and Washington could pretend to only grudgingly accept while making clear that any return of Assange to WikiLeaks would immediately trigger a new extradition request. To achieve this, I could not rely on diplomacy, but had to build up sufficient public pressure to force the involved governments out of their comfort zone. So, I decided not to mince my words, but to call a spade a spade and to throw both the political weight of my mandate and my personal and professional credibility into the balance in order to make myself heard – first of all by the states in question, but also by the media and, hopefully, the broader public.

On 27 May 2019, my first letter went out to the British government, at that time my most important interlocutor in the Assange case. The letters to Ecuador, Sweden, and the United States followed the next day. The four letters were identical as far as my observations were concerned and differed primarily in terms of the respective government’s current responsibilities, my follow-up questions and my specific recommendations, all of which were tailored to each state. All letters contained the standard closing formula announcing that the letter and any response received from the government would be published online within sixty days. All of them also contained the following sentence summarizing my most important conclusion: ‘I am therefore gravely concerned that, starting from August 2010, Mr Assange has been, and currently still is, exposed to progressively severe pain and suffering, inflicted through various forms and degrees of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the cumulative effects of which clearly amount to psychological torture.’

#### Going Public

How could life in an embassy with a cat and a skateboard ever amount to torture? What business does the UN special rapporteur on torture have to even occupy himself with Julian Assange? Doesn’t he have worse cases of torture to address? How often have I been challenged by people questioning the legitimacy of my entire investigation into the Assange case. My answer has always been the same. Yes, there are worse cases. There are always worse cases. But that is not the point. Torture is torture, and any victim of torture is as important as any other, regardless of the gravity of the abuse, their socio-economic status, celebrity, origin, gender or age.

The Assange case is relevant to my mandate in three distinct ways. First, as we have already discussed in detail, the four states involved have jointly exposed Assange to various forms of ill-treatment whose cumulative effects amount to psychological torture. Second, there is a great risk that Assange will be extradited to the United States and imprisoned there in conditions that not only my predecessors and I, but also Amnesty International and many other human rights organizations, have consistently described as amounting to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. And third, Assange has published evidence of state-sanctioned war crimes, including torture, through WikiLeaks. Yet it is Assange who is prosecuted, whereas the torturers and other war criminals enjoy complete impunity. Under the Nuremberg Principles and international criminal law, the US government’s refusal to prosecute its own torturers not only violates the UN Convention against Torture and the international law of armed conflict but amounts to a separate war crime on the part of the responsible military commanders and government officials. Each of these three aspects of the prohibition of torture – investigation of past and present violations, prevention of future violations, and prosecution of perpetrators – is relevant to my mandate and warrants my intervention.

What makes the case of Julian Assange particularly important is that it sets a dangerous precedent and demonstrates systemic failures that not only reach far beyond one man’s individual fate, but also far beyond all of the individual states involved. In the case of Julian Assange, so-called mature democracies of the West are systematically disregarding the rule of law and directly undermining fundamental constitutional rights indispensable to any democratic system: the prohibition of torture, the freedom of the press, the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial. Those who justify their own indifference by pointing to the existence of ‘worse cases’ are making a fatal mistake that will exact a high price from all of us. At best, they miss the big picture of what really is at stake here – the proverbial ‘elephant in the room’. At worst, they deliberately bury their heads in the sand while investigative journalism is being ruthlessly criminalized, persecuted and annihilated. Only the day that they themselves are arbitrarily arrested will they pull their heads back out of the sand and realize that there is no one left to speak up for them.

Given the emblematic importance of the case and the foreseeable reluctance of the involved states to change their abusive conduct, it was not sufficient to simply report my findings to these governments: I had to sound the alarm in public. Assange’s health was an urgent concern, and the threat scenario of an irregular deportation to Sweden or the United States escalated almost daily. At the same time, the British authorities and the mainstream press were outdoing each other in displays of self-righteous delight mixed with indifference. In these circumstances, it would have been irresponsible to wait a full sixty days before informing the public about my alarming observations. I therefore decided to issue a press release and to offer individual interviews to the media.

In my official letter to the governments, I announced my intention to publicly express my concerns ‘in the near future’, and, as per standard procedure, I transmitted an advance copy of my press statement for their information. The headline was released on 31 May 2019: ‘UN expert says, “collective persecution” of Julian Assange must end now.’ On less than two pages, I summarized my conclusions, condemned serious human rights violations and, here too, deliberately did not mince my words. This was no longer about diplomacy – I needed to reach the broader public with clear-cut wording that was sufficiently alarming to challenge the very same deep-rooted prejudices that had clouded my own perceptions of this case. I strongly criticized the continuing failure of the involved states to protect Assange’s human rights and said that ‘by displaying an attitude of complacency at best, and of complicity at worst, these governments have created an atmosphere of impunity encouraging Mr Assange’s uninhibited vilification and abuse.’ Should any doubts about my stance still linger, I certainly dispelled them with this concluding statement: ‘In 20 years of work with victims of war, violence and political persecution I have never seen a group of democratic States ganging up to deliberately isolate, demonise and abuse a single individual for such a long time and with so little regard for human dignity and the rule of law.’

I was fully aware that, with this statement, I had figuratively crossed the Rubicon and there was now no turning back. With my starkly uncompromising stance, I put not only my credibility at risk, but also my career and, potentially, even my personal safety. If nothing else, I certainly would not win any new friends among states. But what would have been the alternative? Should I have acted against my better judgment and expressed my ‘confidence’ in the judicial authorities of the countries involved? Should I have expressed lukewarm concern about Assange’s ‘self-inflicted’ state of health, sweeping all the dirt under the carpet with a few half-hearted recommendations? I was painfully aware that both speaking out and remaining silent would come at a price. But I did not really have a choice. I knew that I would rather be wrongly perceived as a liar, failure, and traitor by the entire world, than rightly by myself. The price of my silence would have been my integrity – a price I was not willing to pay.

Until that moment, I had never been a man of the limelight. Exposing myself in this way made me feel very uncomfortable and triggered a full-blown personal crisis. In so doing, I both outwardly and inwardly broke with my residual trust in the system. With my trust in Western democracies as states governed by the rule of law. As states which, when confronted with irrefutable evidence for human rights violations or war crimes, would unquestionably take the necessary measures of investigation and redress. Now I suddenly found myself with my back to the wall, defending human rights and the rule of law against the very democracies which I had always considered to be my closest allies in the fight against torture. It was a steep and painful learning curve which forced me to question and rethink my entire worldview.

Not even thirty minutes after my press release, the then British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt shot back on Twitter: ‘This is wrong. Assange chose to hide in the embassy and was always free to leave and face justice. The UN Special Rapporteur should allow British courts to make their judgments without his interference or inflammatory accusations.’ The superficial assertiveness of Hunt’s message scarcely concealed to what extent I had caught the British government off guard. It was of course absurd for the foreign secretary to accuse me of ‘interference’ with the British judiciary when, in fact, I had been formally invited by his own government to investigate the case of Julian Assange from the perspective of the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment. In any case, having chosen the weapon, Hunt also relieved me of the diplomatic *bon ton* to not conduct my own official correspondence with government officials on Twitter. My reply followed on the spot: ‘With all due respect, Sir: Mr Assange was about as “free to leave” as a someone sitting on a rubber boat in a shark pool. As detailed in my formal letter to you, so far, UK courts have not shown the impartiality and objectivity required by the rule of law.’
