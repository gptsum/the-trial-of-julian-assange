### Chapter 10: Government Denial of Reality

In the summer of 2019, my office started receiving the responses to the official letters I had sent on 27 and 28 May to the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, Sweden and Ecuador. Australia, and a few months later Germany, also reacted to my conclusions, although I had not formally contacted either of these two states in connection with the Assange case. Remarkably, despite significant differences in terms of attitude and content, the reactions of all six governments had one common denominator: the denial of reality.

#### United Kingdom: Demonstrative Indifference

Sweden, Ecuador and the United States all replied within the standard deadline of sixty days. Only the British government, which had Assange in its power and from which I had therefore demanded the most urgent measures, made abundantly clear that it was in no hurry to respond. Their letter of reply was not sent until 7 October 2019, almost exactly five months after my visit to Assange, as if to demonstrate the indifference of an overconfident world power. The British response was particularly concise and dispensed with all diplomatic courtesies.

Without preamble, the letter rapped out its points: ‘Dear Mr Melzer, The Government rejects any allegation that Julian Assange has been subjected to torture in any form as a result of actions by the UK Government. The UK Government does not participate in, solicit, encourage or condone the use of torture for any purpose. The United Kingdom does not accept that Mr Assange was ever arbitrarily detained; he was free to leave the Ecuadorean Embassy at any time.’ Moreover, ‘Mr Assange has been convicted under English law of failing to surrender to custody following due legal process. Judges in the UK are completely impartial and independent from Government. … Mr Assange did not appeal his conviction and has withdrawn his appeal against his sentence. Yours sincerely, [XX].’ End of message. No response to the urgent concerns expressed by my medical team about Assange’s health. No investigation into British involvement in years of judicial arbitrariness, intimidation, isolation and humiliation. No action to ensure Assange would get adequate access to his lawyers and legal documents. No comment on the risk of serious human rights violations in the event of extradition to the United States. And, last but not least, no ‘assurances of highest consideration’ or similar concluding phrase – in diplomatic parlance, the equivalent of a slap in the face.

The British government clearly had no intention of answering to a mere UN special rapporteur. This had nothing to do with me personally. In fact, whenever other UN experts had reached conclusions deviating from the British government’s complacent self-perception, their reaction had been the same. Whether Raquel Rolnik’s critical 2013 report on the right to adequate housing in the United Kingdom; the WGAD’s 2015 conclusions on Assange’s arbitrary deprivation of liberty in the Ecuadorian embassy; Philip Alston’s disconcerting 2019 report on extreme poverty in the United Kingdom; or now my own concerns regarding the persecution and ill-treatment of Assange: every time, the British government had at first voluntarily engaged with the evaluation process, but then flatly dismissed the inconvenient findings, and aggressively accused the investigating UN experts of partisanship, ‘inflammatory’ remarks, and political motivations. Clearly, a government bent on denying uncomfortable realities would be a difficult interlocutor for constructive dialogue based on facts.

#### Sweden: Bureaucratic Evasiveness

Sweden, too, had difficulties concealing its indignation, but at least it made a show of maintaining diplomatic countenance. In my official letter to the government, I had transmitted credible allegations of serious due process violations on the part of the Swedish Prosecution Authority. In any functioning system of democratic checks and balances, this type of allegation letter transmitted by a mandated UN expert should have automatically triggered a formal investigation by the parliamentary ombudsman for the judiciary or similar independent oversight body. But this obviously was not what the Swedish government had in mind, because that would have raised too many inconvenient questions. Instead, the government reminded me of the constitutional independence of the judiciary, including the Prosecution Authority, and explained that the government could not interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation. The undersigned ambassador seemed rather unconvinced himself, or else he would not have found it necessary to repeat the same argument four times on only three pages.

In my experience, the claim that the executive branch cannot interfere with ongoing judicial proceedings is one of the most common excuses I receive from democratic governments when I confront them with allegations of torture or ill-treatment and remind them of their obligation to investigate, punish, and redress any violations that may have occurred, and to prevent their reoccurrence. All these obligations are binding on the state as a whole and, thus, on all three branches of government. In practice, it is not only the security forces and secret services subordinate to the executive branch that are responsible for torture and ill-treatment, but often also the judicial and investigative authorities. The spectrum ranges from interrogational coercion or suppression of statements to the execution of corporal punishment and death sentences, to deliberate judicial arbitrariness and denial of justice, such as in the case of Julian Assange. As a matter of diplomatic protocol, however, I always have to address my official communications to the minister of foreign affairs of the state in question, even if the abuse is alleged to have been committed by officials of the judiciary. It is then up to the Foreign Ministry to forward my allegation letter to the appropriate national oversight body, to ensure that the investigations required by international law are conducted and that my queries are satisfactorily answered. If I were prevented from addressing abuse by investigative and judicial authorities during a pending investigation, my mandate would really be reduced to a toothless tiger with very limited practical relevance. But then, that outcome is precisely what many states would not be too unhappy to see materialize.

The Swedish letter also pointed out that ‘the Government does not agree with the WGAD’s opinion and its conclusion that Sweden has violated international law. In fact, Mr Assange chose, voluntarily, to remain at the Ecuadorian Embassy, and the Swedish authorities have had no control over his decision to do so. Mr Assange was free to leave the Embassy at any time. He cannot be considered to have been deprived of his liberty while at the Embassy due to any decision or action taken by the Swedish authorities.’ Of course, with the requisite dose of cynicism, the same could be said for any other politically persecuted asylum seeker. In the real world, whether someone is ‘free’ to leave the protection of their political asylum does not depend on whether their presence in the place of asylum is voluntary, but on whether there is a real risk that they will be exposed to serious violations of their human rights once they leave that place. As Assange had correctly predicted, and as has become abundantly clear since his arrest on 11 April 2019, his fears had been well founded all along.

In its response, the government described the possibility of Assange’s extradition from Sweden to the United States as ‘strictly hypothetical’. Presumably just as ‘hypothetical’ as the possibility of a US extradition request was said to be by the British government when it responded to my initial visit request on 10 April 2019 – less than twenty-four hours before it ordered Assange’s arrest in the Ecuadorian embassy and announced that the United States had formally requested his extradition. A more detailed response to my queries or the initiation of an investigation was not considered necessary by the Swedish government. Overall, the message coming from Stockholm very much resembled the one I would receive from London: no wrongdoing, no culpable omissions, no inconsistencies – complete denial of an unpleasant reality.

#### Ecuador: No, No, and No!

Like the British, the Ecuadorian government had difficulties maintaining diplomatic form and composure – but in inverse fashion. In terms of word count, the missive from Quito far exceeded those sent by the other three governments and can only be described as a verbal outburst. The government spotted accusations even where I had not voiced them at all: ‘It is regrettable that you refer to the diplomatic asylum granted to Mr. Julian Assange as a ‘confinement’, a term that denotes the confinement of a person in a closed environment, depriving him of his liberty. In this regard, we would like to remind you that, on 19 June 2012, Mr. Assange entered the Embassy of Ecuador in London voluntarily, of his own accord, and without coercion of any kind.’

I had never claimed otherwise. Any politically persecuted person seeks asylum ‘voluntarily’. However, if the place of his asylum measures only a few square metres, which he cannot leave without exposing himself to the risk of serious human rights violations, then his situation unquestionably amounts to deprivation of liberty. As a matter of law, therefore, Assange was indeed confined at the Ecuadorian embassy, albeit not by the Ecuadorian government, but through a threat scenario created by the Swedish, British and – in the background – American authorities. What I had criticized in my letter to Ecuador was not Assange’s confinement by other states, but his targeted isolation, defamation and humiliation by the Ecuadorian authorities, and the summary termination of his citizenship and asylum in violation of due process and the prohibition of refoulement.

The main responses of the Ecuadorian government and, most notably, their justification for his expulsion have already been discussed in detail. The progressively derailed tone of their letters showed me that I had hit a nerve. Page after page, their personal attacks increased: ‘You, Mr. Rapporteur, and your assistants are obviously free to sympathize with Mr. Assange … but your opinions on the case distort the facts and promote value judgments that compromise your independence as Special Rapporteur.’ Or: ‘Your subjectivity is astonishing, Mr. Rapporteur.’ Or: ‘Zero torture, Mr. Rapporteur. … All this you already know because we informed you before, Mr. Special Rapporteur, why then ask us again?’ Or: ‘We repeat it again, but we are discouraged in doing so because we don’t know if this time we will be lucky enough to have you read what we wrote.’ And finally, ‘there is also new content in your letter that you have not addressed before, it still expresses an obvious prejudice against the Ecuadorian state when you merely repeat what Mr. Assange’s lawyers and supporters say without any supporting evidence.’ In the course of my work, I have rarely received official responses as wordy as this one, but which still left all of my queries unanswered.

#### USA: America Does Not Torture!

The reply of the US government, dated 16 July 2019, included a short cover letter and a one-page substantive response. In my letter, I had expressed grave concern at what I described as ‘a sustained and unrestrained campaign of public mobbing, intimidation and defamation against Mr Assange, consisting of a constant stream of public statements not only by the mass media and influential private individuals, but also by current or former political figures and senior officials of various branches of government’. In this regard, the government was emphatic: ‘The United States rejects the proposition that the types of public statements listed in your letter constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, much less torture, as defined by the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). Further, the United States is deeply concerned by the suggestion that independent reporting or other commentary and discourse on public figures could amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Such a position by the Special Rapporteur has dangerous implications for freedom of expression, democracy, and the rule of law.’

The cynicism of this rationale is striking. On the one hand, the US government justifies the unrestrained defamation, humiliation, and intimidation of Assange based on freedom of expression. But when Assange reveals evidence of war crimes, torture, and corruption, then freedom of expression suddenly ceases to apply, and he is threatened with 175 years in prison.

Furthermore, in the view of the US government, the notoriously inhumane conditions of detention in US high-security prisons have nothing to do with torture or ill-treatment: ‘The United States categorically rejects the claims in your letter that the United States will torture or otherwise mistreat Mr. Assange if he is extradited to the United States to face criminal prosecution.’ Chelsea Manning has a very different story to tell, and she is not the only one. The failure of the United States to prosecute and punish its own torturers, its excessive use of violence, restraints, and isolation against detainees of all kinds, its practice of extorting confessions and testimony through coercive detention and threats of draconian sanctions, and the notorious overcrowding of American detention facilities reflect a remarkable discrepancy between governmental self-perception and the reality on the ground.

#### Australia: The Glaring Absentee

My press release of 31 May 2019 made waves. The interviews piled up, and all of the major media organizations ran at least an online article or a radio interview. Much more difficult were the mainstream television broadcasters. Both BBC World and Sky News, the two most influential British television news channels, initially wanted a live video interview via Skype in the late afternoon. However, both broadcasters took their interviews off the air immediately after the first live broadcast and left no trace of them on the web. My findings that both the British government and the mainstream media had been complicit in Assange’s persecution and torture did not appear to fit their preferred narrative. By contrast, the video interview requested by the Australian public television broadcaster, ABC, remained accessible online. While I had described Australia as a ‘glaring absence’ in the Assange case, I did not have reliable evidence for Australian complicity in his torture and persecution and, therefore, had not included Canberra in my official intervention.

I knew that Assange had been very critical of his home country. Among other things, he had accused Australian authorities of supporting US criminal investigations against WikiLeaks and himself. He had also pointed to media reports that the Australian government had considered cancelling his passport in order to facilitate his prosecution by the United States. Given the military alliance between Washington and Canberra, as well as the country’s longstanding membership in the ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence cooperation between the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, none of this would have come as a surprise. Assange certainly had reason not to trust his government, and repeatedly rejected Australian offers of consular assistance during his time in the Ecuadorian embassy. As questionable as Australia’s abandonment of their own national may be from a moral perspective, I did not have sufficient evidence to speak of legal co-responsibility of the Australian government for the political persecution and ill-treatment of Assange.

So, during an interview with the *Sydney Morning Herald* (*SMH*) published on 31 May 2019, I described the role of the Australian government as follows: ‘Australia is a glaring absence in this case. They’re just not around, as if Assange was not an Australian citizen. That is not the correct way of dealing with that.’ Unfortunately, the *SMH* published the interview with a misleading title: ‘Assange a victim of torture and Australia shares blame, says UN expert’. I had never blamed Australia for Assange’s torture, but that was immaterial now – the damage was done. The Australian government was irritated and, on the same day, released a press statement of its own: ‘We reject any suggestion by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture that the Australian Government is complicit in psychological torture or has shown a lack of consular support for Mr Assange. The Special Rapporteur has not been in contact with the Australian Government to raise these concerns directly.’

While I had not, in fact, accused Australia of complicity in torture or lack of consular support, my remarks seemed to have triggered the sensitivity of a political leadership that was fully aware of its failure to protect its national from serious abuse. As detailed earlier, the Australian government has never sought to use its considerable political leverage as a major ally of the United States and the United Kingdom to end Assange’s persecution. Instead of addressing the case on the political level, where it could have been resolved quickly and effectively, Canberra demonstratively exercised restraint and limited itself to the merely technical and administrative level of consular services. In the world of diplomatic relations, this means that the Australian government needed a modicum of window dressing for domestic consumption, but never intended to fundamentally challenge the dehumanization and persecution of Assange by its allies.

As long as Assange himself did not trust his own government sufficiently to at least accept its consular services, there clearly was no basis for me to try to negotiate a diplomatic solution involving Australia behind the scenes. Whatever the Australian government may have done to protect Assange’s interests in the past decade, none of it has contributed anything to fundamentally changing his situation. Although a group of about two dozen Australian MPs have vehemently campaigned for Assange’s release and repatriation, and two of them – Andrew Wilkie and George Christensen – even travelled to London in February 2020 to visit him in prison, they were unable to persuade their government to change its mind.

During the extradition hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in September 2020, which lasted several weeks, three of the few available public seats in the courtroom had been reserved for diplomatic representatives from the Australian High Commission in London. Outside the court, starting long before dawn, countless journalists, foreign politicians, representatives of Amnesty International and other independent observers waited in vain to be admitted to the courtroom – every single day. By contrast, the cushy Australian seats remained empty – every single day. Given the obvious indifference of the Australian government towards Assange’s rights, there clearly was no potential for a constructive dialogue. Here, too, the self-perception of the political leadership had very little to do with reality.

#### Germany: Between Appeasement and Complicity

Governments that have no direct connection to the persecution or person of Julian Assange generally do not comment on his case at all, or only very cautiously. Remarkably, this is true even across traditional political blocs, so that Assange receives hardly any public support from countries like Russia, China, Iran or Venezuela, which rarely miss an opportunity to criticize the West. This has nothing to do with Assange’s person, of course, but with the fact that the basic idea and methodology of his organization – WikiLeaks – is perceived as an equal threat by all governments alike.

If we have to pick one example to be discussed in this context, Germany is perhaps the ideal choice, both for its commonalities with other countries and for its peculiar specificities. First, Germany is a country with sufficient political, economic and military clout to directly influence the four states involved in Assange’s persecution. Second, Germany is a country that has had its own experience of seeing a highly developed society slide into dictatorship, surveillance state and self-destruction. And third, forced to face the consequences of this system failure, Germany has tried to deal legally, morally and politically with the burden of this past with a rigour and resolve which, despite imperfections, remain unique in the world. Tragically, however, Germany remains unable to effectively call out similar developments in allied states or even to publicly express a clear-cut opinion on them.

Berlin, 7 October 2020: during a parliamentary session in the Bundestag, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas threatens targeted sanctions against Russia over the alleged poisoning of opposition politician Alexei Navalny with a nerve agent belonging to the Novichok group. The minister affirms that the development, production and possession of chemical weapons is a ‘blatant violation’ of international law, adding that ‘Russia itself should have a great interest in solving the crime.’ However, according to Maas, Moscow has so far not complied with any of the German government’s ‘demands and questions’ in this case. Unless Russia provides the required clarifications, he says, ‘targeted and proportionate sanctions against those responsible will be unavoidable.’ The clear messaging from Berlin is widely welcomed, because governments hardly ever find the courage to take such an uncompromising stance.

Later during the same session, Maas is asked about the case of Julian Assange and, in particular, about my official findings that his treatment violates the universal prohibition of torture – another ‘blatant violation’ of international law. Suddenly, the minister becomes significantly less combative. According to Maas, the German government has ‘no information’ indicating ‘that there have been violations of international law in both the accommodation and the treatment of Julian Assange’. The minister believes that ‘Assange deserves a trial in accordance with the rule of law’, but sees no reason to ‘accuse our British partners of any failure or whatever in this case’. So, unlike Russia, the United Kingdom is not being confronted with ‘questions and demands’ from the German government and need not expect German sanctions should it fail to investigate the persecution of Assange and to provide the required clarifications.

Contrary to the minister’s claim that he had ‘no information’ indicating any ‘violations of international law’ against Assange, I had personally briefed his ministry in the matter a year earlier, on 26 November 2019, during a visit to Berlin. On their own initiative, the Human Rights Division of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs had invited me for a meeting at their offices to discuss the Assange case. To my surprise, however, my interlocutors had no intention of discussing the conclusions of my investigation or the measures that could be taken by the German government in order to positively influence the treatment of Assange by the British and American authorities. In fact, no one in the room had read any of my official communications on the case and, throughout the meeting, no one showed the slightest interest in learning about their content. Rather, my interlocutors sat there with grave faces and expressed concern that my engagement in the Assange case undermined not only the credibility of my mandate but even the continued existence of the UN human rights mechanisms as a whole. For these human-rights bureaucrats, the fact that Assange was being held in solitary confinement for months on end, that he was deprived of his human dignity and denied the right to prepare his defence, did not seem to arouse any doubts as to the lawfulness of the British proceedings. Instead, they met my objections with the same blank stares as the government spokespersons who, at the weekly Federal Press Conference (BPK), dismiss any question about the government’s position in the Assange case with stony faces and tortured phraseology – a veritable reality show in wilful blindness.

London, September 2020: one of the many witnesses who testified in favour of Assange in the US extradition trial was a German-Lebanese dual national named Khaled El-Masri. On 31 December 2003, he was arrested by police in Macedonia and handed over to the CIA. In Skopje and in a ‘black site’ in Afghanistan, he was humiliated and tortured by CIA agents for four months until they were persuaded of his innocence and abandoned him somewhere on a deserted road in Albania – without any apology, compensation or even sufficient funds for him to travel home. After several unsuccessful proceedings against the Macedonian authorities, the European Court of Human Rights found in 2012 that El-Masri had been tortured by Macedonian and US officials and ordered Macedonia to pay €60,000 in compensation. Torture being a serious crime, the German Federal Prosecutor’s Office issued thirteen arrest warrants against the CIA agents allegedly responsible for the abuse of El-Masri.

However, the German government subsequently refused to transmit the required extradition request to the United States – a ‘non-justiciable’ discretionary decision by the executive branch, the German Administrative Court found. In reality, the German government’s refusal was a clear violation of the Convention against Torture. That treaty leaves states no discretion whatsoever in determining whether or not to prosecute torture, but unequivocally obliges them to do so in every single instance. Further investigation of the case by a parliamentary committee of inquiry was reportedly rendered impossible because the German government refused to provide evidence and prohibited other witnesses from testifying. As shown by diplomatic cables of the US Embassy in Berlin that were later published by WikiLeaks (07BERLIN242), the United States put the German government under massive pressure not to allow this extradition request to go forward.

Here too, the German government did not ‘ask questions or make demands’. Again, Germany did not threaten the United States with sanctions, despite the ‘flagrant violation’ of international law. Moreover, the torture of El-Masri was not just an unfortunate isolated blunder, but stood for hundreds of similar cases. It stood for a firmly established policy of serious violations of international law by the United States, from unlawful kidnappings and systematic torture in secret prisons scattered around the world, to countless drone strikes coordinated from Germany’s Ramstein Air Base and killing individuals on mere suspicion – an average of two attacks per month under President Bush, rising to five per week under Obama and three per day under Trump. There is a point at which political appeasement becomes complicity under international law.

How closely German security policy is entangled with that of its Western partners behind the scenes can be seen not only in such individual cases, but particularly clearly in relation to the NSA scandal. After the Snowden leaks revealed the targeted surveillance of top German politicians by the NSA in 2013, there were public protests and calls for a German–American ‘no-spy’ agreement, for the establishment of an investigative committee, and for criminal proceedings regarding the surveillance of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s personal phone. The German government initially pretended to support these demands. Once the dust had settled and public interest had waned, however, real-politik quietly took over again: the criminal proceedings were dropped for ‘lack of evidence’, the no-spy agreement was buried without a sound bite, and the investigative committee was prevented from questioning its most important witness, Edward Snowden, in Berlin. In order for Snowden to come to Berlin, he needed a non-refoulement guarantee from the German government against his onward extradition to the United States. Apparently, this would have put too much strain on the German government’s sensitive transatlantic relations. This complacent attitude was not even changed by the WikiLeaks revelations of summer 2015, which provided new evidence that numerous top politicians in Germany had been systematically surveilled by the NSA for many years, including verbatim transcripts of wiretapped conversations of the chancellor. In sum, the German political leadership chose to sweep the biggest surveillance scandal in world history under the carpet, along with the right to truth, transparency and privacy of their own people, and to emphasize the indispensable character of the transatlantic partnership instead.

Since the ‘Crypto-Leaks’ revelations of February 2020, this transatlantic ‘partnership’ is probably better described as ‘complicity’ in the field of intelligence collection, too. Via the trustworthy façade of a Swiss company named Crypto AG, which was secretly owned jointly by the CIA and the German Federal Intelligence Service (BND), Germany and the US had been selling manipulated cipher devices for decades to more than 100 countries. This allowed them to systematically wiretap the communications of well over half of all governments in the world. When after more than twenty years the Swiss National Intelligence Service (NDB) finally discovered the German – American espionage scheme, it did not put a stop to it. Instead, the NDB made a deal with the CIA extending access to the compromised devices to Swiss intelligence agents – causing considerable long-term damage to Switzerland’s credibility as a neutral, secure and trustworthy country.

It was not until 30 December 2020 that the German government’s human rights commissioner, Bärbel Kofler, could bring herself to issue a press release on the Assange case. The commissioner stated that she personally – not the German government or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as a government spokesperson hastened to specify – was following Assange’s extradition trial ‘with concern’; she reminded the United Kingdom of its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, ‘also with a view to the possible sentence and the conditions of detention’. The commissioner’s statement was published on the very last working day before Monday, 4 January 2021 – the day when Judge Baraitser at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London was scheduled to render her first-instance judgment in Assange’s extradition case. Too little, too late. Too little to be taken seriously and too late to influence the decision – worlds away from the fighting talk of the German government in the case of Navalny.

#### The Common Denominator

My dialogue with the four states directly responsible for Assange’s persecution – the United Kingdom, Sweden, Ecuador and the United States – did not end with their initial responses. I was not prepared to accept their excuses, and so wrote an individual follow-up communication to each of the four governments. In these letters, I diligently considered any responses put forward by the authorities, reiterated the need for an official investigation of the case, and explained my findings and reasoning based on more detailed arguments of law and fact. The letters were sent to the United States and Sweden on 12 September, to Ecuador on 2 October, and to the United Kingdom on 29 October 2019. While Quito responded with another verbal volley, Stockholm simply referred back to its initial response and stated that the government had ‘no further observations’ on the case. London and Washington failed to respond at all.

It was now inescapably clear that nothing more could be achieved through the diplomatic channels at my disposal. The involved states had made it understood that they did not wish to enter into constructive dialogue with my office and that they considered the matter closed. I was about to make it understood that I did not. I had seen too much to be able to simply look the other way and pretend nothing had happened. The dysfunctions I had witnessed went far beyond the Assange case and were indicative of a systemic failure of major proportions.

To be sure: the official misconduct described in this book – from the persecution of Assange by the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Ecuador, to the evasiveness of Australia and the wilful blindness of Germany – is neither unique to these countries nor proof of an evil conspiracy. The policy of small compromises, where any moral dilemma is always resolved by following the path of least resistance, and where human dignity, transparency, and accountability are always the second (or third) priority, is universal. This is the globally prevailing ‘operating system’ of any human society, any state, organization or company. This is the unspectacular material from which the most atrocious crimes and the greatest human tragedies are made, through appeasement of the powerful, denial of responsibility and bureaucratic complicity. This is what Hannah Arendt so aptly described as the ‘banality of evil’.

As much as we may be tempted to blame and moralize, the cause of the systemic failure of states to uphold the rule of law – whether in the case of Julian Assange or in others – is not moral in nature, but deeply rooted in neurobiology and social psychology. As I argued in my report to the UN General Assembly in October 2020 (A/75/179), even complex political decision-making processes are chiefly driven by unconscious emotions primarily aimed at securing individual and collective self-preservation and avoiding potentially threatening conflicts. Uncomfortable truths and moral dilemmas are suppressed or glossed over through various forms of self-deception. The result of this self-deceptive process is always a moral black hole in which corruption and inhumanity can be practiced without being perceived as such.

In the case of Julian Assange, these uncomfortable truths are, needless to say, the publications of WikiLeaks. They shine a spotlight on the shameful reality of international relations, on the war crimes and human rights abuses, the corruption, the lies and the rotten compromises. The accuracy of the leaked information cannot be disputed, because the documents have been produced by the authorities themselves. But instead of facing this reality and making the necessary corrections, the exposed states preferred to change the subject of the conversation. They teamed up to snatch the spotlight from the hands of the messenger and turn it against him: Assange, rapist, hacker, spy, and narcissist! Not even a proper journalist! A traitor who risked human lives! The world public and the media were grateful, because it is much easier to mock and scapegoat an isolated individual than to question the integrity of one’s own authorities and, indeed, of the entire political and economic governance system. It is much harder to take political responsibility and to initiate the enormous global governance reforms that must be undertaken if we are ever to achieve the peaceful, just and sustainable societies envisaged in foundational documents such as the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Given the categorical refusal of the involved states to engage in constructive dialogue with my office, the only way for me to make a difference was to confront the wider public with its own self-deception, the same self-deception which had initially distorted my own perception of the case. This would not be easy because, for the past decade, the official narrative about Assange had become deeply rooted in public opinion and relied predominantly on claims and allegations that could not be easily verified or debunked. But one event would come to significantly facilitate my task: the collapse of the Swedish case in November 2019.
