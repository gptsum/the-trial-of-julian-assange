### Chapter 9: A Look across the Atlantic

#### Death Threats from America

On 16 August 2012, Julian Assange’s request for asylum was officially approved by the Ecuadorian government. He had justified his need for diplomatic protection based on the 1951 UN Refugee Convention: ‘This request is made in the belief that I will be sent to the United States where, as a result of my imputed political opinions, I will be persecuted. This persecution will take place in the form of prosecution for political reasons, and excessive punishment if convicted, and inhumane treatment all contrary to the Convention.’

American politicians and journalists have left no room for doubt that Assange would be prosecuted primarily for political reasons rather than for real crimes. Shortly after the WikiLeaks revelations of 2010, which primarily concerned the United States, they begin to prepare the ground for Assange’s public prejudgment. Assange’s asylum request to President Correa provides a list of accusations, defamations and threats made against him. Among the most salient we find:

* ‘I think the man is a high-tech terrorist. He’s done an enormous damage to our country, and I think he needs to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. And if that becomes a problem, we need to change the law.’ (US Senator Mitch McConnell, 5 December 2010)
* ‘[President Obama] should put out a contract and maybe use a drone or something. … I think Assange should be assassinated, actually. … I wouldn’t be unhappy if [Assange] disappeared.’ (Tom Flanagan, former chief of staff to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, 30 November 2010)
* ‘Let’s be clear: WikiLeaks is not a news organization; it is a criminal enterprise. Its reason for existence is to obtain classified national security information and disseminate it as widely as possible – including to the United States’ enemies. These actions are likely a violation of the Espionage Act, and they arguably constitute material support for terrorism.’ (Marc Thiessen, former speechwriter for George W. Bush, 3 August 2010)
* ‘Why can’t we act forcefully against WikiLeaks? Why can’t we use our various assets to harass, snatch or neutralize Julian Assange and his collaborators, wherever they are? Why can’t we disrupt and destroy WikiLeaks in both cyberspace and physical space, to the extent possible? Why can’t we warn others of repercussions from assisting this criminal enterprise hostile to the United States?’ (Bill Kristol, journalist, 30 November 2010)
* ‘Julian Assange poses a clear and present danger to American national security. The WikiLeaks founder is more than a reckless provocateur. He is aiding and abetting terrorists in their war against America. The administration must take care of the problem – effectively and permanently.’ (Jeffrey Kuhner, columnist for the *Washington Post*, 2 December 2010)
* ‘Julian Assange is engaged in warfare. Information terrorism, which leads to people getting killed is terrorism. And Julian Assange is engaged in terrorism. … He should be treated as an enemy combatant.’ (Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the House of Representatives, 5 December 2010)
* ‘A dead man can’t leak stuff. This guy’s a traitor … and he has broken every law of the United States. And I’m not for the death penalty, so … there’s only one way to do it: Illegally shoot the son of a bitch.’ (Robert Beckel, journalist and former campaign manager for presidential candidate Walter Mondale, 6 December 2010)
* [Asked whether Assange was a high-tech terrorist or a whistleblower akin to those who released the Pentagon Papers:] ‘I would argue that it’s closer to being a high-tech terrorist. … This guy has done things and put in jeopardy the lives and occupations of people in other parts of the world. … He has made it difficult to conduct our business with our allies and our friends … It has done damage.’ (Joe Biden, vice president under Barack Obama, currently 46th president of the United States, 19 December 2010).

Strikingly, all of these statements are based on arguments of national security and use terms such as ‘treason’, ‘espionage’, ‘terrorism’, ‘hostility’, ‘combatant’ and ‘warfare’. The preferred solution appears to be Assange’s extra-judicial assassination. Asked by Fox News about the WikiLeaks revelations, Donald Trump said on 2 December 2010: ‘I think it’s disgraceful, I think there should be like death penalty or something.’ It was Trump, of course, who, during his term as 45th US president, would finally force the indictment and arrest of Assange.

Equating Assange with a ‘terrorist’ is not just a question of semantics. Since 9/11, Presidents Bush and Obama had institutionalized a machinery of state-sanctioned assassination through systematic drone strikes against suspected terrorists. Gone was the need for positive identification as a lawful military target, gone the alternative need of an imminent threat, gone the right of every suspect to a fair trial before being sentenced to death. Largely unchallenged by world public opinion, these assassinations conveniently avoided lengthy trials and burdensome due process requirements such as the presumption of innocence, the prohibition of arbitrariness, and public scrutiny by external observers. When confronted with a request under the Freedom of Information Act on whether the CIA had plans to assassinate Assange, the agency on 27 October 2010 responded evasively that ‘the existence or non-existence’ of such plans could be ‘neither confirmed nor denied’. As so often in the assessment of evidence, it is of crucial importance to ask the right questions. In this case, the right question is not, of course, whether the CIA’s reply explicitly confirmed an assassination plan against Assange (which the agency would never do), but whether the agency would have given the same answer with respect to someone whose assassination had never been considered. Just as in the case of Hillary Clinton’s ‘joke’ response to allegations that she had contemplated ‘droning’ Assange, the absence of a firm denial is more revealing than the verbal content of the reply. In fact, according to an extensive investigative article published by Yahoo News on 26 September 2021, several former officials of the Trump administration confirmed that, after WikiLeaks exposed the CIA’s worldwide hacking operations in the Vault 7 release of March 2017, various options for direct action against Assange were discussed at the highest level of the US government, including his kidnapping, rendition and assassination. These allegations were corroborated by evidence emerging from court proceedings against UC Global in Madrid.

#### Secret State Security Trial

WikiLeaks had confronted the world with truths that were difficult to digest. The war crimes, human rights violations and other machinations exposed in these publications were massive. From the perspective of the rule of law, such revelations called for far-reaching institutional reforms in order to prevent similar violations from recurring in the future, but also for a thorough process of justice and redress for the harm done. Soldiers, officials and political leaders had to be held accountable and innumerable victims and their families compensated. But also, the people of Western democracies were challenged to question their own perception of reality, to give up their comforting illusions and take political responsibility. And, as always when people are involuntarily pushed towards expanding their awareness and acknowledging disturbing truths, they initially respond with strategies of denial. A particularly effective psychological pattern is to deny any responsibility or wrongdoing and to demonize the messenger instead. Accordingly, the entire world was soon slandering Assange as a terrorist, a traitor, a spy and a rapist – all emotional, strongly prejudicial labels that were meant to justify his persecution and distract from the uncomfortable truths he had laid bare.

If the unwarranted demonization of Assange is a fairly straightforward phenomenon from the psychosocial and neurobiological point of view, it does raise major human rights concerns. State-sanctioned threats, humiliation and vilification – whether expressed or merely tolerated by the authorities – are incompatible with human dignity and, depending on the circumstances, may well amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or, in extreme cases, even torture. Moreover, in view of the strong prejudice that has been publicly expressed by politicians, mass media and commentators, it is almost impossible for Assange to expect a fair trial in the United States. Given that, in any criminal trial, the defendant is presumed innocent until proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt, his acquittal must be at least conceivable. But even the boldest idealist would probably rule out the possibility of Assange being found innocent in the US Espionage Court of Alexandria. The US government and its ‘reliable partners’ have not spent tens of millions of dollars persecuting and demonizing this man for an entire decade, only to give him the satisfaction of being acquitted of any wrongdoing in an American court.

An aggravating factor are the systemic flaws embedded in the US criminal justice system, which relies heavily on intimidation, coercion and violence to achieve its goals. Central to this is the instrument of plea bargaining, which is used to settle roughly nine out of ten criminal cases throughout the country. A plea bargain is a deal between the prosecution and the defence that comes about when a suspect agrees to plead guilty, usually to a lesser offence, or agrees to testify against another suspect in favour of the prosecution. As a reward for such cooperation – in the case of witnesses it could also be called bribery – the prosecutor then demands a lesser sentence, or drops some or all of the charges altogether. The state thus not only relieves itself of having to prove its accusations beyond reasonable doubt, it also does not risk any compensation claims for unjustified pre-trial detention. The defendant, in turn, does not run the risk of a jury finding him guilty and the court imposing the maximum sentence.

Plea bargains cannot work without a coercive threat scenario that scares defendants into submission. This is often achieved by threatening grotesque prison sentences of up to several centuries or even the death penalty. The purpose is to intimidate defendants to such an extent that they no longer invoke the presumption of innocence but accept a plea bargain, even if it requires a false confession or testimony. It is the exact same rationale that characterizes torture. Defendants know that, in return for their cooperation, they might get away with three years in prison instead of thirty, and with better prison conditions, or that in serious cases they can at least avoid the death penalty. To virtually all defendants, this looks more appealing than the prospect of wasting years in court, accumulating huge legal fees, spending the whole time in prison anyway, and possibly being found guilty by an unpredictable jury. Obviously, the overriding purpose of such a coercive criminal justice system is not to ensure truth and justice, but to force a maximum number of convictions –rightful or wrongful. Equally obviously, it is not conducive to developing or maintaining professional investigative skills; to reducing or eradicating crime, judicial error and arbitrariness; or to alleviating overcrowded prisons. As a result, the United States, with merely 3 per cent of the world’s population, incarcerates no less than 25 per cent of all prisoners worldwide.

In trials involving national security, such as the one Assange would face after his extradition to the United States, the threat of draconian penalties is routinely used to break defendants. For example, the sentence demanded for whistleblower and former CIA agent John Kiriakou was forty-five years in prison. In a television interview in 2007, Kiriakou had given detailed information about CIA torture methods, including the notorious ‘waterboarding’. This method involves the victim’s simulated drowning, interrupted only after unconsciousness has set in and shortly before death by asphyxiation. The victim is then medically resuscitated, and the process is repeated, thirty times, fifty times, 100 times, and in at least one case as many as 183 times. The description of the method as ‘simulated’ drowning does not mean that waterboarding is less traumatic than actual drowning. The agony is the same. The only difference is that the torturer prevents the victim’s physical death from occurring so that their excruciating pain and suffering can be repeatedly inflicted. Kiriakou was accused of having violated his duty of non-disclosure because his testimony allegedly permitted the identification of some of the torturers. In a breathtaking reversal of justice one would sooner expect from a criminal organization than from a democratic state, it was the crime witness who was arrested and charged, and not the criminal perpetrators he had exposed.

Like Assange, Kiriakou was charged at the notorious ‘Espionage Court’ in the Eastern District of Virginia. In the United States, anyone who is facing a trial by jury and can afford it hires a jury consultant. His job is to go through the list of possible jurors and develop defence strategies tailored to the individual jurors based on their personal profiles. Reportedly, Kiriakou’s consultant had previously assisted O. J. Simpson and had never lost a case. But when the consultant went through the documents and saw the list of potential jurors, he had only one piece of advice for Kiriakou: ‘In any other district I’d say let’s go for it, we’re going to win. But your jury is going to be made up of people with friends, relatives at the CIA, the Pentagon, national security, intelligence contractors. You don’t stand a chance. Just take the deal.’ The context of his assessment is that Alexandria is located in the immediate vicinity of Washington. So, any jury reflecting the average population will be made up primarily of people who work for the government, have friends or relatives in the CIA or the Pentagon, or generally tend to be sympathetic to the national security establishment. While this is unlikely to have much bearing on a standard trial for robbery or embezzlement, it is strongly conducive to bias in national security cases. This may well be the reason why the US Department of Justice seems to systematically try such cases in the Federal District of Alexandria, even though there are theoretically almost 100 such districts available nationwide.

Kiriakou followed the advice and took the deal. He pleaded partially guilty and went to prison for thirty months instead of forty-five years. This made him a convicted felon, and President Obama had achieved his goal of consolidating the illegality of whistleblowing. No president in US history has prosecuted as many whistleblowers as Obama, who not only ensured complete impunity for state-sponsored torture but also prevented any other form of accountability for US war crimes. After World War II, Japanese soldiers who had used waterboarding against American prisoners were convicted of war crimes and sentenced to at least fifteen years by the United States. But when the CIA used the same method against suspected terrorists, the United States lacked the strength and integrity to hold them to account. After taking office, Obama acknowledged that waterboarding was torture and a ‘mistake’. But the president now wanted to ‘look forward as opposed to looking backwards’. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate reassured the public that he did not want any ‘witch-hunts’. No witch-hunts for torturers, war criminals and their superiors, that is. For all those who alerted the public to such crimes, however, the president made an exception. In Obama’s view, it was not the torturers and war criminals who had betrayed American values, but those men and women in uniform who – unlike the president – had refused to become complicit in these crimes and had chosen to become whistle-blowers instead. In Sicily they call this code of silence *omertà*.

If Julian Assange is extradited to the United States, his trial will be held at the Espionage Court in Alexandria, before a jury just like the one that would have tried Kiriakou. The proceedings will take place behind closed doors, in the absence of press and public, and based on evidence that will not be accessible to either Assange or his defence counsel – due to imperative ‘national security’ concerns, of course. In short: in the United States, Assange would get a secret state-security trial very similar to those routinely conducted in dictatorships and other authoritarian regimes. At the Espionage Court in Alexandria, no national security defendant has ever been acquitted.

#### The Case of Chelsea Manning

The case of Chelsea Manning was not resolved through a plea bargain. Manning, who leaked the ‘Collateral Murder’ video, as well as the material for the Afghan War Diary, the Iraq War Logs and CableGate to WikiLeaks in 2010, pleaded guilty to ten of twenty-two charges – voluntarily and out of principle, not in return for a ‘reward’ or other bargain. She explained her moral motivation: she wanted to trigger a much-needed public discussion about the misconduct of the US military and thereby contribute to positive change. In July 2013, a military court at Fort Meade in Maryland found her guilty on nineteen of twenty-two charges and, despite her confession, sentenced her to thirty-five years in prison for theft of government property and espionage, among other charges. Prosecutors had demanded an even more extreme sentence of sixty years, but Manning was acquitted of the most serious charge of ‘aiding the enemy’.

Clearly, Manning had violated her duty of non-disclosure as a soldier. In so doing she had committed an offence, even though there is no evidence that anyone has been seriously harmed. In terms of motivation, Manning did not seek to enrich herself or to help the enemy, but she wanted to denounce the systematic violation of the values to which she felt committed as a soldier: truth, law and justice. After unsuccessfully trying to do so through internal reporting channels, she first offered the material to the mainstream press. Only when she was met with indifference there as well did she finally reach out to WikiLeaks. She provided evidence of war crimes, human rights abuses and corruption that the public might otherwise never have known about. But the antiquated Espionage Act does not allow for a public interest defence – the duty of silence is absolute, just like in the Mafia. Accordingly, the undisputable public interest in having war crimes exposed and prosecuted was not taken into consideration in the conviction and sentencing of Manning, and the same would apply in any trial of Assange under the Espionage Act.

Manning was arrested on 27 May 2010. For the first two months she was held in a military facility at Camp Arifjan in Kuwait, then, after her repatriation to the United States on 29 July, at Quantico Naval Base in Virginia. In a harrowing article published in the *Guardian* in 2016, Manning described her solitary confinement during that period. She recalled sitting in front of a mirrored wall through which two Marines watched her every move, seventeen hours a day. No sleep was permitted between early morning and 8 p.m., no lying down, no leaning against the wall, no physical exercise. Deprived of her personal belongings, all she could do was to get up occasionally, walk around in her tiny cell, and dance, because that was not considered physical exercise. Occasionally, three guards would take her outside, to a fenced-in area the size of a basketball court, where she was allowed to walk around for twenty minutes. If she stopped even once, the break would end immediately, and Manning would be taken back to her cell. Visits were allowed only for a few hours a month, from family, friends, lawyers. Manning met them behind a thick glass wall, hands and feet shackled, and some of her conversations were recorded. She was not even permitted to sleep through the night. The guards woke her up as soon she tried to turn to the wall.

Finally, in late December 2010, my predecessor in office, Juan Méndez, formally protested against Manning’s detention conditions and, in May 2011, requested permission for a personal prison visit with her. Contrary to the standard rules applicable to prison visits by a UN special rapporteur, the US authorities did not permit an unsupervised interview with Manning, which would have been necessary for an objective evaluation of her treatment and conditions of detention; Méndez had no choice but to decline the visit. The same would foreseeably happen to me and my successors if we tried to visit Julian Assange in a US Supermax prison. In fact, since the creation of the mandate of the special rapporteur on torture in 1985, no mandate holder has ever been able to conduct official prison visits in the United States. In December 2016, the Obama administration tried to convince me to carry out a last-minute official country visit to the US before the end of Obama’s presidency on 20 January 2017, presumably to provide a bit of window dressing for the outgoing president’s human rights legacy. When I insisted that I would visit only on the condition of unrestricted access to all places of detention, including confidential interviews with inmates held under Special Administrative Measures and at Guantánamo Bay, the conversation was over.

Shortly thereafter, on 17 January 2017, President Obama commuted Manning’s thirty-five-year sentence, ensuring her release on 17 May 2017. Obama’s decision is often described as a generous act of humanity. The reality is less flattering. The president having come under increasing criticism for his ‘war against whistleblowers’ towards the end of his second term in office, his commutation of Manning’s sentence more likely represented another eleventh-hour attempt at mitigating reputational risk. On 11 January 2009, the *New York Times* had quoted then President-elect Obama as reluctant to prosecute the war crimes committed during the Bush administration, because he did not wish for ‘extraordinarily talented people’ at the CIA to ‘suddenly feel like they’ve got to spend all their time looking over their shoulders’. The president was not too worried, however, about Manning enduring seven years behind bars, almost entirely during Obama’s two terms in office, for alerting the public to those war crimes. While Manning’s breaches of non-disclosure were an exclusive matter of US domestic law, the Geneva Conventions do not allow the US president any discretion whatsoever with regard to the prosecution and punishment of war crimes. Moreover, as a commander-in-chief refusing to prosecute torture and war crimes committed by his subordinates, President Obama clearly incurred personal criminal liability under the Nuremberg Principles and the doctrine of command and superior responsibility.

Manning’s persecution did not end with her release. In March 2019, she was called to testify against Assange by the secret Grand Jury in Alexandria, Virginia. When Manning refused to give the requested testimony, the judge jailed her for contempt of court for sixty days. A week after her release, she was again subpoenaed. When she again declined, Manning was placed in coercive detention – she was to remain locked up until she gave the requested testimony. Additionally, she would be subjected to a daily fine of $500 beginning on the thirtieth day and of $1,000 beginning on the sixtieth day of renitence. A few months later, on 1 November 2019, I formally protested to the US government against Manning’s coercive detention: ‘I conclude that such deprivation of liberty does not constitute a circumscribed sanction for a specific offence, but an open-ended, progressively severe measure of coercion fulfilling all the constitutive elements of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.’ It is one thing to punish someone with a defined prison sentence for refusing to testify in court. But it is quite another to subject a witness to indefinite detention in order to force her to testify, thus incrementally increasing her suffering until she breaks. The former is a lawful sanction. The latter is prohibited torture.

Because of the purely coercive nature of the actions taken against her, I demanded Manning’s immediate release, as well as the return of any fines improperly obtained. Despite the urgency of my appeal, I never received any reply from the US authorities, and even the publication of my letter and its dissemination in the mass media two months later failed to elicit any official response. Then happened what I had feared the most: on Wednesday, 11 March 2020, shortly after 12 noon, Chelsea Manning attempted to commit suicide in prison. In the end, the severity of the suffering inflicted by her endless coercive detention had simply become too much to bear. She was found in time and survived. But the judge had now seen the writing on the wall and ordered Manning’s release, supposedly because her testimony before the grand jury was ‘no longer necessary’. She received no compensation for her arbitrary detention, nor was she relieved of her accumulated fine of $256,000. Will Julian Assange, too, have to attempt suicide before the world finally opens their eyes to what is being done to him and, through him, to all of us?

#### ‘Special administrative measures’

In his June 2012 asylum request to the Ecuadorian government, Assange explicitly referred to Manning’s conditions of detention: ‘The likely charges, the attitude of the US government towards me and the known circumstances of placement of individuals on comparable charges mean that I will, again with certainty, be imprisoned in conditions that mirror those experienced by my alleged co-accused Bradley Manning.’ As became clear during the September 2020 extradition hearing in London, if sent to the United States Assange would not only be held in solitary confinement but would almost certainly be additionally subjected to what are called Special Administrative Measures (SAMs), both pre-trial and while serving his sentence. This euphemism denotes a particularly restrictive detention regime imposed by the attorney general, that is, the head of the US Department of Justice. SAMs can be ordered before, during, or after a trial. They are not a sanction imposed by the judiciary, but a security measure taken by the government. As such, they are not subject to judicial review and cannot be effectively challenged by the detainee. SAMs are used against detainees who, in the view of the attorney general, pose a particular threat to national security, such as suspected or convicted terrorists, spies or whistleblowers.

The main purpose of SAMs is to strictly control an inmate’s communication with others inside and outside the prison facility. As we know from numerous reports and witness statements, what this means in practice is near-total isolation. Apart from contact with lawyers, only two short phone calls are permitted per month. If and when family visits are permitted, they take place through a thick glass barrier without any physical contact, and prisoners remain shackled, chained at the wrists, ankles, and to the ground. All visits require fourteen days’ advance notice and can take several months to coordinate.

Apart from that, inmates are in total isolation twenty-four hours a day. No communication whatsoever is permitted with other inmates, and even prison staff do not interact with inmates except for opening the viewing slot during their inspection rounds and delivering meals through the secure meal slot in the door. Recreation is limited to one hour daily and takes place in small indoor cages the same size as their cell, without any exercise equipment and often in the middle of the night, when other inmates are sleeping.

Inside the cell: no newspapers, no radio, no television. Showers only three times per week. Violations of the rules are punished immediately. The slightest misunderstanding with prison staff can result in a prisoner being handcuffed in his cell for a week, spending the entire time in complete darkness, with a bag over his head or blindfolded. The government’s tight grip on the communication of SAMs inmates means that no email contact is permitted and letters may be written only on rare occasions, to approved addressees only, and subject to elaborate censorship procedures that can delay their delivery for several months. One SAMs detainee – Abu Hamza al-Masri – reportedly broke the rules when he wrote a letter asking his son to tell his one-year-old grandson that he loved him: the grandson was not on the list of approved addressees.

Psychological services are offered primarily through self-help packages and information provided by video; participants in group therapy are kept in individual cages and remain shackled during therapy sessions. Lawyers or family members visiting SAMs inmates can be criminally prosecuted if they talk among themselves or with others about the detention conditions they observe. The SAMs regime makes the abuse of power and arbitrariness easy, beyond control, and absolute. As a last means of resistance, some detainees go on hunger strike hoping to obtain modest forms of relief: to be allowed to call home twice a month, or to read an occasional newspaper. But hunger strikes are brutally suppressed by forced feeding, often carried out in a particularly torturous manner.

SAMs can be imposed for a period of up to one year and are renewable without limit. The government can decline to provide any justification. After all, SAMs are – by definition – a matter of national security. There are convicts who have spent ten years under this particularly cruel, inhuman and degrading regime. In my view, there is no question that these conditions of detention violate not only the prohibition of torture under human rights law, but also the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment of the US Constitution. In the world of technicalities, of course, SAMs are not a punishment, but only ‘administrative measures’. In the real world, however, the term ‘Special Administrative Measures’ is nothing but another fraudulent label for torture, and for a detention regime that dehumanizes not only the detainees but also their tormentors, the instructing authority and, ultimately, any society which tolerates and enables such cruelty in the name of justice.

#### Press Freedom or National Security?

On 15 October 2019, I participated in a panel discussion at Columbia University in New York. It was entitled ‘Press Freedom, National Security and Whistleblowers: From Julian Assange to the White House’. The room was packed, with some people standing or sitting on the floor. In the audience was James Goodale, who had represented the *New York Times* in the Pentagon Papers litigation during the Vietnam War and whose interview on the Assange case had been an important eye-opener for me. During the discussion, the eighty-six-year-old stood up and took the floor. ‘Is Assange entitled to the full protection of freedom of the press?’ Goodale answered passionately in the affirmative. If the US government wanted to prosecute Assange under the Espionage Act, he said, it would first have to prove that his publications had actually posed a clear and imminent threat to national security. ‘It would seem that such proof would create a high bar for the government to jump – particularly when the government has never stated once whether there has been damage to anybody as a consequence of Assange’s publication. It has, of course, said such publication caused general damage to national security but has not particularized any harm to anyone such as for example, its Afghanistan sources. … the government has had ten years to come up with evidence that shows damage to national security but has not.’

Indeed, the claim that Assange’s publications have caused serious harm to US national security, endangered American soldiers, and exposed local informants to acts of revenge by the enemy is one of the earliest and least scrutinized myths. On 30 July 2010, just after the publication of the Afghan War Diary, US Chief of Staff Mike Mullen stated: ‘Mr. Assange can say whatever he likes about the greater good he thinks he and his source are doing. … But the truth is they might already have on their hands the blood of some young soldier or that of an Afghan family.’ Strikingly, the general seemed to be much less concerned about the blood on the hands of his own soldiers, who in the ‘Collateral Murder’ video massacred wounded civilians and their rescuers. Nor did it seem to occur to him that war crimes such as that one had destroyed countless Afghan and Iraqi families, driven embittered civilians into the arms of terrorist groups, and provoked acts of revenge against US personnel and civilians. The short-sightedness of the self-righteous is their greatest weakness.

Similarly, US Defense Secretary Robert Gates told Senator Carl Levin in a letter of 16 August 2010: ‘The documents do contain the names of cooperative Afghan nationals and the Department [of Defense] takes very seriously the Taliban threats recently discussed in the press. We consider this risk as likely to cause significant harm or damage to the national security interests of the United States.’ However, he acknowledged that ‘the review to date has not revealed any sensitive intelligence sources and methods compromised by this disclosure.’ Three years later, the situation remained unchanged. At Manning’s trial in July 2013, Brigadier General Robert Carr, a senior counterintelligence officer who headed the Information Review Task Force that investigated the impact of WikiLeaks disclosures on behalf of the US Department of Defense, told the court that they had uncovered no specific examples of anyone who had lost their life as a consequence of these publications.

Before Assange, no one has ever been charged under the Espionage Act merely for publishing sensitive documents. What, then, would a conviction of Assange mean for the future of investigative journalism? Without a doubt, it would set a precedent by which any journalist publishing leaked material on national security and defence policy issues could face similar criminal charges. If it were not for the establishment of a judicial precedent for the purpose of intimidating investigative journalism, the aggressive prosecution of Assange would make no sense at all. What is at stake, therefore, are not just the personal rights of Assange, but nothing less than the continued ability of the press, as the ‘Fourth Estate’, to inform and empower the people and, thereby, ensure democratic oversight of governments.

In an interview with *Der Spiegel*, WikiLeaks editor Kristinn Hrafnsson therefore rightly spoke of a ‘war on journalism’, and Reporters Without Borders called the charges against Assange a ‘dangerous precedent for journalists, whistleblowers and other journalistic sources’. Even the former assistant attorney general for national security, Kenneth Wainstein, said in 2010 at a US congressional hearing: ‘If WikiLeaks can be prosecuted for espionage for these leaks, there is no legal or logical reason why a similar prosecution could not lie against all of the mainstream news organizations that routinely receive and publish protected “national defence information”.’ This is no small problem for those who want to see Assange indicted and convicted. Not surprisingly, therefore, they do everything in their power to distinguish WikiLeaks from traditional news organizations and prevent the equation of Assange’s work with journalism.

Ultimately, however, the motive behind the aggressive persecution of Assange is always the same: fear. Fear of the WikiLeaks methodology and its proliferation; fear of transparency, truth and new revelations; fear of democratic control and accountability; and, above all, fear of losing power. In the words of Leon Panetta, former CIA chief and US secretary of defense, in an interview with ARD, ‘All you can do is hope that you can ultimately take action against those that were involved in revealing that information, so that you could send a message to others not to do the same thing.’ To achieve this goal of deterrence, new legal contortions are constantly being attempted. Thus, during a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) on 13 April 2017 – shortly after the Vault 7 leak had exposed the CIA’s worldwide hacking activities – then CIA director Mike Pompeo claimed that WikiLeaks was a ‘non-state hostile intelligence service’ and that Assange, as a foreigner, was not entitled to the protection of the press freedom guarantees of the US Constitution. That’s how simple it was in Mike Pompeo’s world. From a legal perspective, however, interpreting the US Constitution fortunately is not up to the director of the CIA, but to the Supreme Court. But the CIA seems to care as little about the Constitution as it does about the international legal obligations of the United States. These international obligations also include respecting and ensuring freedom of expression, which can be restricted only by law and only for compelling reasons, especially to protect national security. As Goodale had correctly noted, therefore, everything hinges on whether Assange and WikiLeaks actually endangered the national security of the United States – and not just its international reputation and the impunity of its leaders for war crimes, torture and corruption. So far, the US authorities have been unable to provide any evidence for this claim. Indeed, correctly understood, press freedom and national security are not contradictory but symbiotic – and official secrecy is their common enemy.
