### Chapter 12: Public Opinion Begins to Turn

#### Setting the Record Straight

To the broader public around the world, the rather subdued discontinuation of the Swedish investigation came as a surprise. For more than nine years, the Prosecution Authority had been able to deflect criticism as to the paralysis of its investigation by accusing Assange of evading justice. But with his arrest by British police on 11 April 2019, the tables had turned. Suddenly Assange was at the disposal of the Swedish authorities, and they still had a comfortable window of sixteen months to interview and formally charge him with the alleged rape of S. But just six months after reopening the investigation, Prosecutor Persson threw in the towel and publicly admitted that the evidence at her disposal was not sufficient to initiate a criminal trial against Assange, nor was there any prospect of improving the evidentiary situation by interviewing him or taking any other investigative measures. After years of being fed an unbending ‘rape suspect’ narrative, the public was confused and divided: no arrest warrant, no extradition request, no interview and, worst of all, no prosecutable evidence?

Since presenting my preliminary findings in May 2019, I had been trying to raise awareness of the enormous implications of this case for the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment, for press freedom and freedom of information, for the extraterritorial overreach of US jurisdiction and, indeed, for democracy and the rule of law. But the official Swedish narrative of Assange as a fugitive rape suspect was so firmly entrenched in the public mind that it was very difficult to expose its instrumentalization for the purposes of political persecution without being misunderstood as relativizing the importance of prosecuting sexual offences. The fact that the Swedish authorities refused any constructive dialogue in the matter further complicated my investigation and required me to repeatedly adjust, clarify, and supplement my conclusions in order to accommodate new evidence.

Particularly in the early stages of my investigation, I was criticized by many who genuinely feared for the hard-fought gains of the women’s rights movement. I was censured by long-time colleagues, lost a research assistant, and received letters of protest from women’s rights organizations, lawyers, academics, and even one of the two Swedish women. I did my best to address these legitimate concerns, to clarify my position and to resolve misunderstandings. Most importantly, I made unequivocally clear that my criticism was in no way directed against the women or their rights and integrity, nor against the description of the alleged conduct as serious sexual offences, but solely against the authorities and their deliberate abuse of a legal process for the purposes of political persecution. In fact, I considered A. and S. to be victims of state instrumentalization just as much as Assange himself.

It was also from established women’s rights organizations, such as the London-based ‘Women Against Rape’, and from hundreds of rape victims and their relatives that I received the most determined public support. They stood up for justice and truth in the case of Julian Assange. They rejected the deliberate instrumentalization of a rape narrative for the persecution of an inconvenient dissident, when sexual violence on the part of soldiers and agents of the same states was routinely hushed up and victims of domestic and sexual violence can rarely rely on effective protection but are often doubly humiliated and traumatized by inadequate attitudes, policies and practices.

In fact at that time, I was working on a report on domestic violence from the perspective of the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment (A/74/148), which I presented to the UN General Assembly in New York in October 2019. What most shocked me during my extensive consultations on the topic, besides the enormous scale of the violence and cruelty to which women and children especially are exposed in their own homes worldwide, was the nonchalance with which this enormously destructive form of torture and ill-treatment is routinely trivialized, ignored or even instrumentalized by governments – even though it has produced more death, suffering and injustice than all the wars in human history combined.

#### A First Breakthrough

The collapse of the Swedish case and the prosecutor’s formal acknowledgement of the lack of evidence put an abrupt end to the official narrative of the ‘fugitive rape suspect’, which for so long had haunted all efforts to raise awareness of the persecution of Assange. So far, with the laudable exception of the American magazine *Newsweek*, none of the established Western media organizations had covered my Assange investigation in any serious detail; none had even challenged the veracity of my findings in an in-depth interview, and none had confronted the relevant governments with the disturbing questions raised by my interventions. Now, suddenly the path was cleared to once again see Julian Assange as an individual entitled to human rights and dignity, as a publisher who had exposed evidence of war crimes, torture and corruption, and as a courageous dissident who had dared to stand up to the most powerful states in the world.

If there was no evidence for the rape allegations, perhaps the other accusations needed to be questioned as well? Could it be that Assange had been wrongly accused of being a hacker, a spy, a traitor and a narcissist? The increase of public interest opened up new opportunities to communicate the findings of my investigation to a wider audience. I spoke at the European Parliament, the German Bundestag, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and the Swiss Parliament. I also appeared at public events and gave interviews. A first, decisive breakthrough came with a long and brilliantly conceived interview by journalist Daniel Ryser in the Swiss online newspaper *Republik*, published on 31 January 2020 in both German and English, which made my findings accessible to a wide audience and triggered renewed interest in the mainstream media, particularly in the German-speaking world.

Since the beginning of my investigation, I had also been in direct contact with a growing network of individual supporters. From outspoken celebrities like Roger Waters, Pamela Anderson, Vivienne Westwood and Joe Corré, to progressive politicians like Yanis Varoufakis, Sevim Dağdelen and Tulsi Gabbard; to fearless publicists like John Pilger, Stefania Maurizi and Craig Murray. My contacts further included Assange’s lawyers and family members, WikiLeaks staff, and countless activists, journalists, professionals and former officials who, for various reasons, were able and willing to contribute important pieces to the puzzle of my investigation. For reasons of source protection, publishing a full list of their names here would be neither wise nor appropriate.

With the collapse of the Swedish case, my network suddenly expanded deep into the political mainstream to include personalities such as former German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, investigative author Günter Wallraff, Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights Dunja Mijatović, and Swedish Bar Association Secretary General Anne Ramberg. Their public support convinced others and triggered a worldwide surge in solidarity and protest throughout 2020, including high-profile calls for Assange’s release on the part of former heads of state, former ministers, as well as various associations of lawyers, medical doctors and journalists. One by one, entire organizations started to change course, protest against Assange’s persecution and demand his release, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Reporters Without Borders, the Committee to Protect Journalists, the International Bar Association, and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.

From February 2020, among other things, I also supported an initiative by the government of the Canton of Geneva, championed by Member of Parliament Jean Rossiaud, to convince the Swiss federal government to issue a humanitarian visa to Assange. Should the British courts refuse Assange’s extradition to the United States, or should the US and the UK both agree to release Assange on humanitarian grounds – a face-saving way out for all parties – this humanitarian visa would allow Assange to come to Switzerland for a rehabilitation stay at the University Hospitals of Geneva.

Until early March 2020, I literally gave several interviews every single day, had journalists and filmmakers in my office, spoke on video conferences, and travelled to London several times for public speeches and private meetings with Australian parliamentarians, American and British documentary makers, lawyers, and assorted celebrities. The escalating media interest was further fuelled by the beginning of Assange’s extradition trial on 24 February 2020. But then came the COVID-19 pandemic and, shortly thereafter, global lockdown. The world now had other preoccupations besides the fate of Julian Assange and the broader implications of his case. Nevertheless, overshadowed by the destructive force of the pandemic, the benign seed of truth, too, had been planted and began to spread around the world. I was convinced that it was only a matter of time before the critical mass required for a worldwide change of public opinion would be reached.

#### Rapporteur-Turned-Dissident

For me personally, 2019 and 2020 had been years of disillusion and resolve. The disillusion concerned the credibility of Western democracies as allies in the fight for human rights; the reliability of our constitutional checks and balances to oversee the exercise of governmental power; and the practical effectiveness of UN mechanisms in protecting human rights. But this loss of illusions also gave me the resolve to put myself on the line and confront the international community of states with its hypocrisy. The same international community that had appointed me as a UN special rapporteur in 2016, when as a senior security policy advisor to the Swiss government I was still very much part of the system. I had taken my mandate literally, had exposed torture and ill-treatment wherever I encountered it in my work and had refused to bend the rules for reasons of personal or political expediency. Now, with my investigation into the case of Julian Assange, I had inadvertently become a dissident within the system myself.

Nothing illustrated this transformation more emblematically than my brief public address on 27 November 2019, at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. On Pariser Platz stood a sculpture by the Italian artist Davide Dormino. Cast in bronze, Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Chelsea Manning stood on three chairs, silent and upright. Unbowed. Next to them was a fourth chair, empty, inviting people to step up and take a stand. Very appropriately, Dormino had titled the sculpture ‘*Anything to say?*’ Several politicians had already taken the floor at a lectern next to it. As I listened to them, the fourth chair of the sculpture looked glaringly abandoned. So, when it was my turn to speak and I was handed the microphone, I did not hesitate but stepped up onto the fourth chair. From up there I looked across the square, the huge US embassy to my right, and felt as if I were doing something forbidden. I was aware that I had crossed another line with this symbolic gesture that physically placed me in line with the three most persecuted dissidents of the Western world. It was not that I had overstepped my mandate. On the contrary, given the refusal of the involved governments to cooperate with my office, this really was the only way I could still exercise my mandate with independence and effectiveness. If I could no longer rely on the governments currently in place to live up to their international obligations, I had to directly address the people of the UN member states, because it was they who were the ultimate sovereign and had collectively committed to respecting and protecting fundamental human rights at all times. If my mandate was not to degenerate into a fig leaf for a dysfunctional system of self-deception, I could not be intimidated, but had to speak truth to power – not only with words, but whenever possible also with powerful symbolic gestures.

This is what I had to say:

‘For decades, political dissidents have been welcomed by the West with open arms, because in their fight for human rights they were persecuted by dictatorial regimes. Today, however, Western dissidents themselves are forced to seek asylum elsewhere, such as Edward Snowden in Russia or, until recently, Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. For the West itself has begun to persecute its own dissidents, to subject them to draconian punishments in political show trials, and to imprison them as dangerous terrorists in high-security prisons under conditions that can only be described as inhuman and degrading.

‘Our governments feel threatened by Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, and Julian Assange, because they are whistleblowers, journalists, and human rights activists who have provided solid evidence for the abuse, corruption, and war crimes of the powerful, for which they are now being systematically defamed and persecuted. They are the political dissidents of the West, and their persecution is today’s witch-hunt, because they threaten the privileges of an unconstrained state power that has gone out of control.

‘The cases of Manning, Snowden, Assange and others are the most important test of our time for the credibility of Western rule of law and democracy and our commitment to human rights. In all these cases, it is not about the person, the character or possible misconduct of these dissidents, but about how our governments deal with revelations about their own misconduct.

‘How many soldiers have been held accountable for the massacre of civilians shown in the video “Collateral Murder”? How many agents for the systematic torture of terror suspects? How many politicians and CEOs for the corrupt and inhumane machinations that have been brought to light by our dissidents? That’s what this is about. It is about the integrity of the rule of law, the credibility of our democracies and, ultimately, about our own human dignity and the future of our children. Let us never forget that!’

The sculpture subsequently toured Europe and, almost exactly eighteen months later, I once again stood on that bronze chair on the occasion of the ‘Geneva Call to Free Assange’ launched by the Swiss Press Club on 4 and 5 June 2021. Julian Assange was still isolated in Belmarsh, and his extradition trial had reached the appeal stage in the British High Court, but public opinion had evolved since that first speech in Berlin. By my side were not only Assange’s partner Stella Moris and many other long-time supporters of Assange, but also Yves Daccord, a former director-general of the ICRC, Christophe Deloire, the secretary-general of Reporters without Borders, Carlo Sommaruga, member of the Swiss Federal Parliament, and even the mayor of Geneva, Frédérique Perler, who powerfully proclaimed that ‘Assange has sacrificed his liberty in order to protect ours!’

Six months earlier, on 4 January 2021, a lower court in Britain had already set a legal precedent effectively criminalizing investigative journalism worldwide, and Assange’s state of health was declining. So, when I stepped up on that fourth chair for the second time in June 2021, just a stone’s throw away from the majestic Palais Wilson that hosts the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, I spoke with an increased sense of urgency:

‘Ladies and Gentlemen, we are in Geneva. It is the city of the United Nations, the city of the Red Cross, and it is the city of human rights. I am standing here next to Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Chelsea Manning. The truth is: all of them are being persecuted, mistreated and demonized for one thing and one thing only; for having told the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth about the misconduct of Western democracies. They are the skeletons in the closet of the West. Their persecution and mistreatment is what destroys the credibility of the West. When the Western governments today protest the persecution of Alexei Navalny and of Roman Protasevich, the responsible governments only laugh and ask, “Well, what about Edward Snowden who is being protected in Russia? What about Julian Assange, who is in solitary confinement without having committed a crime but telling the truth? What about Chelsea Manning, who was being persecuted to the point of almost dying in an attempted suicide?”

‘Whistleblowers and journalists who publish such information are inconvenient truthtellers. They are as inconvenient as the fire alarm in your house. When a fire goes off in your house and there is smoke, you hear the alarm. We all know the drill: we have to leave the house, we have to leave our work, our daily routine. It is inconvenient, and many voices come up and say: “Just switch off the alarm.” That is what these governments are trying to do when they persecute and isolate and silence these people. They are silencing the fire alarm in the building of democracy and the rule of law. And if I stand up here on this chair today, it is because I was the fire alarm in the United Nations for this case. And I rang the alarm bell, and I wrote to these governments, and I informed the public, but they wanted to ignore the alarm. No one reacted. So, we are inconvenient truth-tellers, the four of us and the millions of others out there that speak the truth. Inconvenient truths. You can switch off the fire alarm for now, and you will feel comfortable for a couple more moments. But the next time you open your eyes, and you wake up and look around, the whole building will be on fire! It is now in the hands of the public to react. Thank you, Geneva, for hosting us here, thank you for giving us this platform. I know this voice goes out to the world!’
