### Epilogue

This book has shown that, first and foremost, the trial of Assange is a story of persecution – the persecution of an inconvenient dissident who has exposed the dirty secrets of the powerful. In doing so, this book points far beyond the individual case of Assange. It exposes a systemic failure of our democratic institutions under the rule of law – institutions that ordinary citizens tend to rely on without ever seriously questioning their fundamental integrity. This systemic failure, in turn, raises questions about truth, deception and self-deception, about our own lethargy and passive co-responsibility. It is not by chance that this book begins with my own difficulties in recognizing and overcoming personal prejudice.

Ultimately, this is a book that concerns every single one of us, that confronts us with our own blind spots in our perception of reality, and that challenges us to look honestly into the mirror and take both personal and political responsibility. Today, humanity faces profound problems that, within a few decades, will seriously threaten our collective survival and that cannot be overcome or eliminated through smooth talk, self-deception and denial. Self-awareness, honesty, and responsibility have therefore ceased to be simply a matter of personal morality, belief, or lifestyle, and instead have become a question of collective survival.

While investigating the case of Assange, I repeatedly had the impression of being plunged into a real-world version of ‘The Emperor’s New Clothes’. The folk tale is well known: an emperor is offered a new outfit by swindlers, clothes that are supposedly visible to everyone except the ‘stupid’ and ‘incompetent’. In reality, of course, the clothes so dearly sold to the emperor are not only invisible, but inexistent. However, since neither the emperor nor his subordinates wish to be considered stupid or incompetent, they all pretend to see the new clothes, and at a public parade the entire nation applauds the ruler’s imaginary costume. But then, suddenly, a child breaks the spell by exclaiming: ‘Look, the emperor is naked!’

So it is with the trial of Assange. Although the crimes and arbitrariness on the part of the various authorities have become increasingly blatant and obvious over the past decade, this dimension of the case has been almost completely ignored by other governments, the established media, and the general public. Instead, the official narrative has been obediently assimilated, repeated and perpetuated: Assange the rapist, hacker, spy, and cowardly narcissist, who has the blood of innocents on his hands and must finally be brought to justice. Here, too, someone had to come along, take a fresh and objective look at everything, and break the spell exclaiming, ‘Look, the emperor is naked!’ This, dear reader, is the purpose of this book.

We must not allow Assange’s persecutors to dictate his story, for those who suppress their own crimes and misconduct are unlikely to tell us the truth about a man who lifted the veil and exposed their corruption. We must not allow ourselves to be side-tracked or confused but must always insist that the spotlight be directed where our attention belongs: not on Assange, the man, but on Assange’s persecutors, the states. For Assange is not persecuted for his own crimes, but for the crimes of the powerful. Their impunity is what the trial of Assange is really about. It is the powerful – whether governments, corporations, or organizations – who undermine our democratic institutions and the rule of law; who refuse to prosecute torture, war crimes, and corruption; who betray our legal systems and shared values for self-serving purposes. The persecution of Assange establishes a precedent that will not only allow the powerful to keep their crimes secret but will even make the revelation of such crimes punishable by law. Let us not fool ourselves: once telling the truth has become a crime, we will all be living in a tyranny.

If the governments persecuting Assange had acted in good faith, they would have prosecuted the crimes revealed by WikiLeaks as required under the rule of law. After all, we are talking about wars of aggression, torture, murder and corruption. The fact that not a single military commander, political leader, soldier or other official has been held accountable gravely sabotages the credibility, legitimacy and authority of our democratic institutions, and should send a cold chill down our spines.

The problem really is not that we do not know the truth, but that we do not want to know it. The problem is that we allow the powerful, against our better judgment, to disregard justice and the rule of law, and that we do not hold them accountable, either legally or politically, but celebrate them as great leaders and possibly even honour them with Nobel Peace Prizes. The problem is that we allow corporate bosses to ruthlessly destroy our livelihoods and shamelessly exploit the vast majority of the world’s population, and still admire them as benefactors and philanthropists when they donate a few billion dollars from their looted wealth for the mitigation of humanitarian disasters they helped to create. We do not want to see that the corporate media that feed us our understanding of world politics, and our personal circumstances, are owned by the very same people who also finance the election campaigns and careers of our politicians. Nor that those politicians, in turn, pass the laws and make the billion-dollar investments that keep allowing an increasingly narrow segment of society to enrich themselves at the expense of the general public and of future generations.

This inherently exploitative, destructive and inhumane system is promoted in the name of the rule of law, democracy, national security and the free market economy. And anyone who does not believe in the official narrative is branded ‘stupid’ or ‘incompetent,’ just like in the old story of the emperor’s new clothes. And since none of us wish to be considered ‘stupid’ or ‘incompetent’, we usually do not dare to question and expose the nonsense before us. Most of us are also too busy taking care of daily life to ask fundamental systemic questions and demand a public debate on them. And so, both the sweet lies of the powerful and the conspiracy theories of the sceptics become increasingly absurd, and produce a public opinion marked by uncertainty, confusion and a lack of verifiable fact – we have arrived in the era of’ post-truth’.

After more than twenty years of experience in the international system, I know too much to be either an idealist or a conspiracy theorist. I know the political mills of the United Nations just as well as the purported constraints of national economic, foreign and security policies; I know the law, treaties and jurisprudence just as well as the world of diplomatic negotiations and the brutal realities of war, crisis and disaster. Governments around the world are increasing their efforts to divert public attention from war crimes, abuse, and corruption. Secrecy, impunity, and arbitrariness are poisoning our democratic institutions and robbing them of their integrity. Interventions by mandated UN mechanisms are ignored or even condemned as interference with internal affairs. Press freedom, transparency and accountability – indispensable prerequisites for the democratic oversight of any public authority – are now more threatened than ever.

When the truth is suppressed by rampant secrecy and censorship; when war criminals and exploiters enjoy impunity; when investigation reports on state-sanctioned torture are classified as secret; when documents released by authorities under freedom of information laws are almost entirely redacted; when the established press no longer exercises its role as the ‘fourth estate’, but meekly censors itself – then we really live in a virtual world, deprived of any possibility to find out what exactly our governments are doing with the power and tax money we have entrusted to them. Then we need leaks in the system, cracks through which the light can penetrate and provide us with information.

As soon as those in power see their essential interests threatened, they tend to disregard the rule of law as a boundary for their conduct. While this may be crudely evident in authoritarian states, the same tendencies are at play in mature democracies, albeit generally disguised in a cloak of legality or, if all else fails, secrecy. This is not because those in power have maliciously conspired against us, but simply because that is how we, as human beings, are wired and have always behaved. In the absence of social control, we all tend to pursue short-term self-interest, and to overlook the long-term societal harmfulness of our behaviour. The problem is not the good or bad character of those at the top, but that we have created and maintain a political and economic system that allows for unmitigated power, secrecy and impunity. With such a lopsided system, we will not be able to effectively respond to the enormous challenges we face as a global community. Whether for climate protection, economic justice or human rights, we need a system that is transparent, fair and sustainable. To achieve this, we must start by opening our eyes and, without condemnation or idealization, acknowledge who we really are and how we really function. Only on the basis of a sober sense of self-awareness will we be able to take political responsibility, expose harmful power structures, make the necessary systemic adjustments, and hold decision-makers accountable.

Even in the darkest room, the light of a single candle is enough to enable everyone to see. Julian Assange has lit such a candle with his work. He has exposed crimes, abuse and corruption that had been concealed behind a curtain of secrecy. It was only a brief glimpse behind the curtain, but sometimes one glimpse is enough to change our entire worldview. We now know that this curtain of secrecy exists and that a parallel universe of dirty secrets hides behind it. Secrets that many of us might prefer not to know, because that knowledge forces us to wake up, grow up and step up. Beyond the discomfort of disillusion, however, that same knowledge also empowers us to carry out the systemic governance reforms required to save us from certain self-destruction. Each and every one of us can change the world through courageous action. To make the darkness disappear, we need not look elsewhere for the light. It is sufficient to let our own light shine, right where we are in our everyday life. To do this, all we need is the courage to be honest with ourselves and with the world.
