### Chapter 8: Ecuadorian Embassy Asylum

#### Australian ‘Declaration of Abandonment’

At around 1 pm on 19 June 2012, Julian Assange enters the Ecuadorian embassy in London – the next turning point in the story of his persecution. For the next almost seven years, he will not leave the red-brown brick building with white window frames, centrally located in close proximity to the luxury department store, Harrods. Assange seeks protection from America’s wrath and therefore applies for political asylum. His written application states, among other things: ‘It is my belief that the country of which I am a national, Australia, will not protect me and the country to which I am due to be extradited imminently from the UK, Sweden, will not prevent my onward extradition to the US. I ask that protection be extended so far as is reasonably possible, to prevent such an occurrence.’

Throughout the Swedish extradition proceedings, from January 2011 to May 2012, Assange’s lawyers in London had repeatedly appealed in writing and in person to the Australian government, asking for diplomatic intervention to protect Assange. These appeals were transmitted through the Australian Embassy in Stockholm and the Australian High Commission in London, but also directly to Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd and Justice Minister Nicola Roxon. According to his lawyers, in Sweden, Assange faced not only many months of detention in near-complete isolation and a secret trial for alleged sexual offences, but also the risk of irregular surrender to the United States – a risk that could also materialize in the United Kingdom. Their main request was always the same: the Australian government should urgently obtain assurances from both Sweden and the United Kingdom that Assange would not be extradited to the United States under any circumstances. There, influential individuals in public life had made death threats against him, and he risked a politically motivated trial for journalistic activities that should not be criminalized as espionage in the first place. Of particular concern, they argued, was not only the ‘excessive use of extreme isolation’ by US authorities, but also the prevailing practice of coercing guilty pleas and supporting testimony through the threat of enormous sentences in case of non-cooperation. For the same reasons, the lawyers also asked the Australian government for assurances that, if repatriated to Australia, Assange would not be extradited to the United States.

These letters triggered an intense internal discussion between ministries in Canberra, especially regarding Assange’s possible extradition to Sweden and onward surrender to the United States. Internal assessments were produced, emails went back and forth, and their content differed significantly from official government pronouncements. This correspondence leaves no doubt that the Australian authorities were well aware of the risk of a ‘temporary surrender’ of Assange from Sweden to the United States for the purpose of criminal proceedings. The Australian officials plainly attached no importance to the Swedish government’s assertions to the contrary. In the world of diplomatic relations, the fact that Stockholm refused to issue a non-refoulement guarantee to Assange spoke a clear language and left no room for misunderstandings.

Against this background, Australia’s unwillingness to stand up for a politically persecuted national can only be described as shameful. The government’s official responses remain formalistic, self-righteous and sanctimonious, but in substantive terms completely distant and noncommittal. The primary smokescreen deflecting from its manifest indifference is the claim that extradition proceedings are always a ‘matter of bilateral law enforcement cooperation’, governed by the domestic laws and practice of the states involved, in which Australia ‘would not expect to be a party’. Nevertheless, the ‘expectation that Mr. Assange’s case will proceed in accordance with due process’ has been expressed to both the Swedish and British governments on several occasions. If Assange were to return to Australia, it would be within the government’s discretion to refuse his extradition to the United States, but this would have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, and no assurances could be given at this time. In effect, Assange’s lawyers rightly spoke of an Australian ‘Declaration of Abandonment’ – he had been discarded by his own government.

#### British Plans to Storm the Embassy

Assange’s last resort is Ecuador, whose president, Rafael Correa, has proved to be a supporter of WikiLeaks in the past. Assange knows that he can obtain diplomatic asylum solely on the grounds of political persecution, not in order to escape Swedish rape investigations. He is seeking protection from possible extradition to the United States, where he faces a real risk of life in solitary confinement and possibly even the death penalty because of his work for WikiLeaks. For Assange, this is the only reason for his asylum request, and for Ecuador it will be the only reason for granting his request.

On 19 June 2012, Assange has come to the Ecuadorian embassy to stay. The government in Quito reacts quickly and grants temporary protection, pending a detailed examination of Assange’s request. During these first days, the diplomatic staff, led by Ambassador Ana Albán, faces major logistical challenges. The embassy has a total of only ten rooms, all of which are located on the same floor. No one is prepared for a permanent guest. A bedroom must be set up for Assange, and the sanitary facilities must be expanded. He will be given a computer and internet access. He can also use the small kitchenette. Step by step, his improvised accommodation becomes permanent. For the time being, Assange is safe – or trapped, depending on the perspective. British police are deployed in front of the embassy and demonstratively block the way out. They, too, have come to stay.

Humiliated by Assange’s move, the British government struggles to retain its posture. On 15 August, the day before Ecuador is to render its final decision on Assange’s asylum status, a British embassy official in Quito hands the Ecuadorian government a ‘note verbale’ for the contingency of Assange being granted diplomatic asylum: ‘You need to be aware that there is a legal base in the UK, the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987, that would allow us to take actions in order to arrest Mr Assange in the current premises of the embassy.’

A thinly veiled warning that Britain is prepared to storm the embassy, the note verbale concludes with the words: ‘We very much hope not to get to this point.’ It later transpires that Foreign Secretary William Hague himself insisted on this unprecedented threat, against the strong reservations of his legal advisers. Predictably, it results in diplomatic upheaval.

Secretary Hague’s Ecuadorian counterpart, Ricardo Patiño, has strong words: ‘If the measures announced in the British official communication materialize they will be interpreted by Ecuador as a hostile and intolerable act and also as an attack on our sovereignty, which would require us to respond with greater diplomatic force.’ Patiño quite rightly considers the British threat a clear breach of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. He fears a dangerous precedent that would open the door to the violation of any nation’s sovereign spaces, which include embassy buildings. On 24 August, the Organization of American States (OAS), quickly convened by Ecuador for an extraordinary meeting, came to the same conclusion. In their final resolution, the OAS-states declare their solidarity with Ecuador and vigorously reject any attempt ‘that might put at risk the inviolability of the premises of diplomatic missions’.

William Hague has made a mistake, and he knows it. He has to row back. The British Foreign Office now asserts that there was never any threat to storm the embassy. It was all just another unfortunate misunderstanding. Even with the risk of a violent invasion banned, however, the siege of the embassy building remains real. One of the Metropolitan Police officers on duty outside the embassy carries a document with handwritten notes under his arm, which is captured by a press photographer with a highly sensitive camera lens. At least parts of the document can be deciphered and reveal instructions that, in case of an exit from the embassy, Assange is to be arrested ‘under all circumstances’, even if he should be in a diplomatic vehicle or hidden in a diplomatic bag. In both cases, such an arrest would still be a clear violation of the international law on diplomatic immunity. In order to grasp the political magnitude of these events, it must be stressed that no state would dare to blatantly violate the international law on diplomatic relations just to enable a foreign country to interview a man who has repeatedly expressed his willingness to fully cooperate under the terms of mutual legal assistance, who is not violent, and whose case has been stuck at the preliminary investigation stage for two years without any realistic prospect of an indictment, let alone a conviction. The threat to forcibly seize Assange from the Ecuadorian embassy illustrates not only the British government’s anger at the unforeseen turn of events but, above all, the immense political dimension of this case. In reality, of course, the British government is not in the least concerned with the Swedish investigation and certainly not with the petty offence of bail violation which Assange committed when seeking asylum in the embassy. No government in the world would consider storming a foreign embassy except in extreme circumstances, such as terrorist attacks, hostage-taking, or other serious and imminent threats to public safety. Apparently, the world power Britain indeed perceives Assange as a threat of this magnitude.

Assange himself is well aware of the big picture. In a brief speech, delivered from the balcony of the embassy building on 19 August 2012, he thanks the Ecuadorian government, embassy staff, and all other supporters, and then appeals to the US president: ‘I ask President Obama to do the right thing. The United States must renounce its witch-hunts against WikiLeaks. … The United States must pledge before the world that it will not pursue journalists for shining a light on the secret crimes of the powerful.’ He goes on to demand the same for whistleblowers like Chelsea Manning, who by then has been in American custody without trial for more than 800 days.

#### ‘Don’t you dare get cold feet!’

On 31 August, two weeks after Assange had received formal asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy, an interview is published quoting him as saying: ‘The Swedish government could drop the case. I think this is the most likely scenario. Maybe after a thorough investigation of what happened they could drop the case.’ The British Crown Prosecution Service is not amused. Less than three hours after the publication, they send an email calling their Swedish colleagues to order: ‘Don’t you dare get cold feet!’ Eighteen months earlier, the British had strongly advised the Swedes against questioning Assange in London or through remote means; now they are warning against dropping the case. Again, one might ask: Why are they doing this? Why are they so invested in a case that doesn’t even involve a British national? Should they not be relieved if Sweden no longer wants to pursue the case? After all, there would be no more expenses for the siege and surveillance of the embassy, and no more public protests against Assange’s persecution. For the sake of credibility, Assange’s bail violation could still be sanctioned with a fine, in addition to the confiscation of the bail deposit of £200,000. After that, the whole case could be closed, and everybody could return to business as usual. But that is not what is happening. Instead, the British authorities seem to have a strong interest in Sweden continuing its investigation and maintaining a threat scenario against Assange. At the same time, the Swedish prosecutor does not seem to be genuinely keen to get Assange extradited to Sweden. When on 29 November 2012 her British colleague jokingly writes, ‘I am sure you can guess what I would just love to send to you as a Christmas present’, she replies ‘I am OK without any Christmas present. In fact, it would be a great shock to get that one!’ Just a joke? Perhaps. But every joke contains a grain of truth.

Be that as it may, after more than a full year of standoff, Swedish enthusiasm seems to wane. The arrest warrant issued back in 2010 cannot be maintained forever, and with Assange having permanently settled into his diplomatic asylum, the embassy siege is unlikely to end anytime soon. Prosecutor Ny seems to be under gradually mounting pressure from the Swedish judiciary. Early on Friday, 18 October 2013, she writes an email to the Crown Prosecution Service which – significantly – is entitled ‘Question’. But, instead of asking a question, she explains the constraints imposed by Swedish law on open-ended coercive measures: ‘There is a demand in Swedish law for coercive measures to be proportionate. The time passing, the costs and how severe the crime is to be taken into account together with the intrusion or detriment to the suspect. Against this background we have found us to be obliged to consider to lift the detention order (court order) and to withdraw the European arrest warrant. If so this should be done in a couple of weeks.’ Then, she ominously comments: ‘This would affect not only us but you too in a significant way.’

The concluding sentence of the message, which must have contained the ‘question’ announced in its title, is redacted as it was apparently considered too delicate for the public to know about. Did she ask whether the British authorities had any objections? The tone and content of the ensuing dialogue certainly suggests so. The British response follows in the late afternoon: ‘I would like to consider all the angles over the weekend, if that is OK with you.’ Why would the British have to ‘consider all the angles’ of a Swedish decision to lift a Swedish detention order in a Swedish case? This correspondence is odd enough given that, in the Assange case, the British CPS supposedly represents the interests of Sweden in the United Kingdom, and not the other way around. But the correspondence gets even more revealing. First thing on Monday morning, 21 October, Marianne Ny follows up: ‘I am sorry that this came as a (bad) surprise. It is certainly OK for you to take your time to think this over. … I hope I didn’t ruin your weekend.’ Why on earth would Sweden’s director of public prosecution ever apologize to a British mid-level official for ‘ruining his weekend’, just because she announced that he might soon be relieved of this burdensome case?

On 2 December 2013, Prosecutor Ny seems to refer back to this correspondence when she writes, ‘I didn’t make myself clear at all, asking for your views’, and then specifies: ‘The costs that are to be taken into account are those on your side and your views on this are weighty. It has been argued in Sweden that the English police regards the costs getting unreasonably high. I understand from your answer that the costs on your side is not an issue that we should take into consideration at this stage?’ Again, the Swedish prosecutor shows a remarkable level of deference to British interests in determining her own handling of this case. On 10 December 2013, the CPS responds: ‘Just to confirm that I do not consider costs are a relevant factor in this matter. … I have certainly not been aware of any adverse comment or concern being expressed by any government departments.’ As we now know, from 2012 to 2019, British police spent more than £16 million on besieging the Ecuadorian embassy – far too much smoke for a small fire, and therefore again a clear indication of the political dimension of this case.

#### Second Discontinuation of the Swedish Investigation

For the time being, the British pressure works, and the Swedish courts remain complacent, leaving the European Arrest Warrant in place and the preliminary investigation in a dormant state. This enables Prosecutor Ny to maintain and perpetuate a completely artificial impasse by refusing to facilitate a governmental non-refoulement guarantee that would allow Assange to return to Sweden safely for a police interview, while also refusing to interview him remotely by video conference or on-site in London under applicable mutual legal assistance agreements. It is only in March 2015 that the Swedish Supreme Court begins to lose patience with her prosecutorial procrastination and indicates its willingness to lift the arrest warrant against Assange on grounds of proportionality.

For almost five years, Prosecutor Ny has been insisting that her investigation required Assange’s personal presence in Sweden: because it would be against the law for her to interview him in London; because a DNA sample had to be taken from him; because of the seriousness of the offences alleged against him; and for unspecified ‘technical investigative’ reasons. But in 2015, under pressure from the Supreme Court, all these insurmountable obstacles seem suddenly to have vanished into thin air, and the prosecutor agrees to interview Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Mainly due to formal disagreements between Sweden and Ecuador, however, another twenty months will pass before this interview actually takes place. In the meantime, the allegations of sexual harassment and sexual coercion made against Assange in the case of A. have expired under the applicable five-year statute of limitations. The same applies to the false accusation complaint that was filed in August 2010 but not pursued by Eva Finné, the chief prosecutor for Stockholm. At the end of August 2015, both these issues were definitely off the table.

The fact that the case of A. became time-barred without formal charges being filed is often conveniently blamed on Assange ‘hiding’ in the embassy. What is generally forgotten is that, in the case of A., Assange had already been interviewed by the Swedish police on 30 August 2010, within a few days of the initial police report. On that occasion, Assange was formally notified of the main allegation against him, namely that he had deliberately destroyed a condom during sexual intercourse, and he responded to all questions asked by the police. Moreover, since 7 December 2010, Assange’s DNA profile had been available to the Swedish authorities via British mutual legal assistance and, on 15 July 2011, the State Forensic Laboratory SKL rendered its detailed report on the requested DNA samples. Thus, at the latest by 15 July 2011, the Swedish Prosecution Authority had all the evidence it could conceivably expect to obtain in order to decide whether to press formal charges or to discontinue the investigation for lack of evidence. Instead, Prosecutor Ny needlessly continued to procrastinate for more than four years until, finally, the case of A. was pushed beyond the line of expiry and became time-barred. Of course, as an experienced prosecutor, Marianne Ny must have understood the evidentiary hopelessness of her case against Assange. To her, allowing the case of A. to expire must have been the most elegant and convenient of all solutions, whereas it was probably the worst outcome for Assange. Not only did it perpetuate the criminal suspicion against him without the prosecutor ever being required to offer any evidence, it also allowed her to blame Assange for cheating both A. and the public out of their right to truth and justice. What is hardly ever considered is that, in this way, Assange would effectively be stigmatized as a fugitive sex offender for the rest of his life and there was virtually nothing he could do about it. In my view, that was very likely the real purpose of the entire Swedish investigation.

After the case of A. has been closed and archived, on 13 August 2015, the Swedish preliminary investigation now focuses exclusively on the alleged rape of S. In her case, the applicable ten-year statute of limitations expires in August 2020. The announced interview of Assange by the Swedish prosecutor takes place at the Ecuadorian embassy in London in November 2016. An Ecuadorian prosecutor asks the questions prepared by the Swedish authorities, but Assange’s Swedish lawyer is not allowed to participate. After that interview, Assange’s lawyers call on the Swedish Prosecution Authority to finally either file formal charges or close the case. But Prosecutor Ny does neither, until Assange’s lawyers once again apply to the Stockholm District Court on 3 May 2017 and ask for the arrest warrant to be lifted. The very next day, the court asks the Prosecution Authority to provide a response by 17 May.

Prosecutor Ny knows that she has to act. It has been two years since the Swedish Supreme Court had signalled its willingness to revoke the arrest warrant against Assange on grounds of proportionality and, unsurprisingly, the interview at the Ecuadorian Embassy has not yielded the evidence required for a formal indictment. The law thus obliges her to admit to the lack of evidence and close the case, clearing Assange of all wrongdoing. If she does not, the Supreme Court will be obliged to do it in her place, because the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure is clear: ‘The preliminary investigation shall be conducted as expeditiously as possible’; ‘The investigation should be conducted so that no person is unnecessarily exposed to suspicion, or put to unnecessary cost or inconvenience’; ‘Upon the conclusion of the preliminary investigation, a decision on whether to institute a prosecution shall be issued’; ‘When there is no longer reason for pursuing the investigation, it shall be discontinued.’

On 19 May 2017, Prosecutor Ny chooses the only option that allows her to circumvent these safeguards of the law and to continue to perpetuate the rape suspect narrative against Assange without the required evidence. She ‘discontinues’ the preliminary investigation into the alleged rape of S. but claims that its proper conclusion is rendered impossible because Assange remains under the protection of the Ecuadorian embassy. The prosecutor explains that ‘it is now not possible to take any further steps that would move the investigation forward’ and that ‘to continue with legal proceedings would require Julian Assange’s appearance in court’, thereby implying that his absence is the only reason for not proceeding with a formal indictment and trial.

From a procedural perspective, of course, this rationale is putting the cart before the horse. The decision to formally charge a suspect never depends on his physical presence, but on the strength of the evidence against him. Only once the suspect is formally charged may his physical presence become necessary for the purposes of conducting the actual trial. As we now know, despite all those years of investigation, Prosecutor Ny never possessed sufficient evidence to formally charge Assange of any crime. However, instead of acknowledging this reality, conceding to the presumption of innocence and rehabilitating Assange’s reputation, the Swedish prosecutor deliberately perpetuates the false impression that the only procedural obstacle to a successful criminal trial is Assange’s purported evasion of justice. The official narrative must be protected at all costs. Only through Assange’s continued stigmatization can public attention be diverted from the actual elephant in the room: the dirty secrets of the powerful.

The final days before Prosecutor Ny closes the Swedish rape investigation are marked by a bitter culmination. Assange’s secret lover and partner Stella Moris is pregnant, and the birth of their son Gabriel is imminent. Per Samuelson, his Swedish lawyer, forwards a personal letter from Assange to Marianne Ny, in which he asks permission to attend the birth of his son at a London hospital: ‘Your written agreement to this request will entail the temporary suspension of the effect of the European Arrest Warrant so that I am able to be transported, without publicity, to the maternity unit. I will remain there until my partner and child are discharged from the hospital, after which time I will return to the Ecuadorian embassy. My transport to and from the hospital will occur in a diplomatic vehicle.’

But Prosecutor Ny’s answer is unequivocal: ‘Request rejected. There lacks the necessary legal prerequisites to temporarily suspend, or make an exception to, the court’s decision that you are to be detained in your absence as well as the issued [*sic*] of the European Arrest Warrant’. On 26 April, the prosecutor sends her decision in Swedish to Assange’s lawyer, followed by the English translation on 16 May. By the 16th, of course, Marianne Ny is fully aware that she will discontinue the Swedish investigation against Assange only three days later. Assange pleads with her to reconsider, but to no avail. With this last deed, Marianne Ny bows out from the persecution of Assange. On 19 May 2017, she discontinues the Swedish investigation. But Assange remains confined to the Ecuadorian embassy. All of a sudden, the British authorities have become particularly keen on prosecuting Assange’s bail violation five years earlier – the only accusation against him that has not yet been dropped or disproven – and, in the background, the US Department of Justice ramps up its efforts to indict Assange under the Espionage Act of 1917.

#### NSA Scandal and DNC Leaks

Even during Assange’s asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy, WikiLeaks continued to work, publishing a wide range of leaked material, not only from Western governments, intelligence agencies and corporations, but also from countries such as Russia, Syria, Angola, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. It was also during this time that the ‘NSA scandal’ erupted. In 2013, Edward Snowden, an employee of the US National Security Agency (NSA), made the headlines with explosive revelations about global surveillance programmes operated by US intelligence agencies, many in cooperation with British, Australian, Canadian and European partner agencies. For the first time, the world learned about the enormous scale and reach of state-sponsored internet and smartphone surveillance, which involved clandestine access to hundreds of millions of private email accounts and smartphones, and large financial incentives for cooperative technology companies.

Snowden did not seek whistleblower anonymity but affirmed the authenticity of the material by disclosing his identity. This made him a target. The United States accused him of espionage. Assange and WikiLeaks assisted Snowden’s escape via Hong Kong to Moscow and helped with exploring options for political asylum in various countries. Bolivia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Iceland were reportedly considered, but Snowden remained in Moscow, where he was granted asylum in August 2013 and permanent residence in October 2020. In the film ‘*WikiLeaks – Die USA gegen Julian Assange*’ (WikiLeaks – The USA vs Julian Assange), aired by German public broadcaster ARD in 2020, Edward Snowden drew parallels between his own case and that of Assange, but at the same time emphasized an important distinction: ‘I was the one who actually gathered this material. I am an American, I had a contract with the government. And yet in the case of Assange, he did not gather any material himself. He received it and then merely published it. He signed no contracts. He was not an American. He is by far the weaker case in terms of what the government has against us. And yet, Assange receives less support in terms of opposition to the charges against him.’

The distinction between unlawfully gathering confidential information and publishing it in a journalistic manner is of critical importance with regard to Assange’s work with WikiLeaks. It also applies to the so-called DNC Leaks. In 2016, in the middle of the US presidential elections, WikiLeaks published around 20,000 internal emails of key staff of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), as well as of Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager, John Podesta. The publication occurred immediately before the Democratic Party convention in Philadelphia, at which Clinton was to be nominated the party’s presidential candidate. The published correspondence provided evidence of strong bias within the Committee against Clinton’s strongest competitor, Bernie Sanders. Apparently, Sanders’s nomination was to be prevented at all costs, including through deliberate defamation. As a consequence, the DNC chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, was forced to resign. The second leak occurred on 6 November, only two days before the presidential election, in which Clinton ended up winning the popular vote but losing the electoral college to the Republican candidate Donald Trump.

No other publication has cost Assange as much goodwill in the United States as the DNC Leaks. The American liberal establishment, including many political figures, business leaders, Hollywood stars and other celebrities, struggled to come to terms with this defeat. How could the venerable Democratic Party, with a candidate as prominent as Hillary Clinton, have lost to someone like Donald Trump, widely despised as crude and self-absorbed? The truth is, of course, that all of the compromising emails had been written by Clinton, her staff and supporters – not by Assange. The truth is that Clinton lost the election because of her own conduct and that of the Democratic Party, not that of Assange. The truth is that in any democratic election process, exposing the dirty secrets of political candidates is an indispensable function of journalists. The truth is that even political celebrities such as Hillary Clinton are not ‘entitled’ to electoral victory but have to earn it themselves. And the hardest truth is that it was not WikiLeaks that gave Donald Trump the presidency, but the American people, in an American election, based on the American Constitution.

All of these truths rose to the surface of public consciousness, but were too painful to face and, therefore, were immediately suppressed back into the subconscious. As the German poet Christian Morgenstern famously said, ‘What cannot be, must not be!’ A scapegoat was urgently needed, and so Assange was accused of having manipulated the 2016 elections, prevented Hillary Clinton from becoming president, and helped Donald Trump into office. But even a scapegoat could not divert public attention forever from the longstanding misconduct that was the most likely cause for the colossal loss of confidence suffered by both established parties with the American people. What was needed was an external enemy. Sure enough, the mainstream press soon started disseminating the US intelligence agencies’ favourite narrative of ‘Russian hacking’.

Within days the Democratic Party accused the Russian Federation of stealing the emails and joining forces with Trump, Assange and WikiLeaks to manipulate the election. In 2018 the party filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against all of the above. But Judge John Koeltl’s ruling, handed down on 31 July 2019, did not turn out as expected by the Democrats. Koeltl did not have to question Russia’s responsibility for the data theft, but simply explained that, due to the principles of sovereign immunity, the Russian Federation could not be sued in the courts of the United States for governmental actions. More importantly, the claims against Donald Trump, his campaign team, WikiLeaks and Assange were also dismissed, this time based on the First Amendment of the US Constitution.

Presumably to the dismay of the entire political establishment on both sides of the aisle, Koeltl described Assange as a ‘journalist’ and considered the publications of WikiLeaks protected as a matter of press freedom. The judge stressed that ‘there is a significant legal distinction between stealing documents and disclosing documents that someone else had stolen previously.’ More specifically, he argued, the First Amendment precluded the liability of those who ‘publish materials of public interest despite defects in the way the materials were obtained so long as the disseminator did not participate in any wrongdoing in obtaining the materials in the first place’. Importantly for Assange, Koeltl then went on to dismiss the conspiracy rationale: ‘The DNC’s argument that WikiLeaks can be held liable for the theft as an after-the-fact coconspirator of the stolen documents is also unpersuasive. … such a rule would render any journalist who publishes an article based on stolen information a coconspirator in the theft.’ Therefore, Koeltl concluded, ‘journalists are allowed to request documents that have been stolen and to publish those documents.’ The DNC’s lawsuit had backfired spectacularly and inadvertently prompted a veritable landmark judgment of enormous value for WikiLeaks, Assange and press freedom more generally.

True to his principles, Assange never disclosed his source for the DNC leaks. On 15 August 2017, ex-US Congressman Dana Rohrabacher and his assistant Charles Johnson visited Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London in order to propose a deal. According to Assange’s lawyer Jennifer Robinson, who was present at the meeting, the visitors made it understood that they were acting with the knowledge and consent of President Trump and that their aim was to explore a possible win-win deal that would allow Assange to leave the embassy without fear of US prosecution. At the time, President Trump was being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, on allegations that he had committed treason by conspiring with Russian agents in the DNC leaks. The proposed deal was that, if Assange were to disclose his real source for the DNC leaks, disproving the allegation that the emails had been provided by Russian hackers, Rohrabacher would lobby Trump for a presidential pardon on the espionage charges against Assange. Assange declined – and Washington’s wrath was not long in coming. On 21 December 2017, the US government transmitted a diplomatic note to London requesting Assange’s provisional arrest; on 6 March 2018, a secret Grand Jury in the United States filed a sealed indictment against him; and within three weeks, Assange’s living conditions in the Ecuadorian embassy began to deteriorate drastically. It was the beginning of the end of Assange’s diplomatic asylum – made possible by an absolutely decisive event that had taken place ten months earlier: the change of leadership in Quito.

#### A New Government in Ecuador

In May 2017, Lenín Moreno replaced Rafael Correa as president of Ecuador. The Ecuadorian people had believed that the election of former Vice President Moreno would ensure the continuation of Correa’s progressive policies. They were in for a shock. This was not going to be a simple transfer of power between politicians of the same tradition. Within a few months of taking office, the Moreno government bowed to economic and political pressure and performed a neoliberal U-turn, putting the normalization of the country’s relations with the United States at the very top of the agenda. Suddenly, Assange’s asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy became an obstacle on the path of US–Ecuadorian rapprochement.

Various options were explored. As the *New York Times* revealed in December 2018, President-elect Moreno received a visit from President Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort as early as mid-May 2017. Moreno seized the opportunity to offer Manafort Assange’s rendition to the United States in exchange for financial concessions, including debt relief. But Manafort became a primary target of Special Counsel Mueller’s ‘Russiagate’ investigation, which ended his role as a middleman. In the following months, Moreno then apparently tried to get rid of Assange by, first, giving him Ecuadorian citizenship in December 2017 and then appointing him ambassador of Ecuador to Moscow. But the British authorities made clear that they did not recognize Assange’s diplomatic immunity and would arrest him as soon as he were to leave the embassy. Three months later followed the secret US indictment on 6 March 2018 and, in late June, US Vice President Mike Pence visited Ecuador to hold ‘constructive discussions’ with Moreno about Assange. The precise content of these talks was kept secret, but parallel developments inside the Ecuadorian embassy speak for themselves.

Fidel Narváez, consul general of the Ecuadorian embassy in London until the summer of 2018, provides a sober, unexcited, yet largely positive evaluation of Assange’s first years of asylum. According to Narváez, the situation was obviously not easy, neither for the embassy staff nor for Assange, but everyone did their best to adapt. Of course, wherever people have to live together in a confined space, there will be occasional situations of stress, he said. Additionally, there was the constant police surveillance, media attention, political pressure, outside visitors, logistical difficulties in securing food, hygiene and medical care, and the indefinite duration of Assange’s presence inside the offices of the embassy, which were not designed for that purpose. In view of all these challenges, the former consul found it remarkable that, overall, the co-existence of the embassy staff with Assange had been marked by friendliness and mutual respect for five years. There was a brief exception in October 2016, when the Ecuadorian government temporarily suspended Assange’s access to the internet during the US presidential election, in order to mitigate the political tensions caused by the DNC leaks while at the same time reaffirming Ecuador’s commitment to shield Assange until his life and integrity could be otherwise secured. In view of Ecuador’s military and economic vulnerability, the country deserves to be saluted for its decision to stand up to international pressure and protect Assange from extradition to the United States. In this respect, the then Ecuadorian leadership showed exemplary courage and commitment to fundamental principles of international law, including the universal prohibition of torture and the principle of non-refoulement.

Assange’s everyday life at the embassy, which remained largely unproblematic until 2017, was certainly facilitated by a character trait of his which, for lack of a better word, could be called ‘resilience’. This man was not accustomed to luxury. For years he had lived out of a suitcase and slept wherever a couch was on offer, the internet was working, and people were willing to support WikiLeaks. In addition, Assange seemed to be strongly focused on his own work, his own person, his own thoughts, keeping the external world emotionally at arm’s length. This ability of his is likely to have helped Assange to get through the first few years of his embassy asylum reasonably unscathed – despite the lack of sunlight, despite the uncertainty of his situation, and despite the constant threat of a looming extradition to the United States, knowing that his entire future depended on the decisions of others.

#### The Refuge Becomes a Trap

The change of power in Ecuador is another turning point in the story of Assange’s persecution. It takes a few months for the fallout of this event to reach the Ecuadorian embassy in London, but when it does, Assange’s daily life changes drastically. One by one, reputedly Assange-friendly employees are removed and replaced by others who are willing to implement President Moreno’s new policies without criticism. On 8 January 2019, the British minister Alan Duncan notes in his diary: ‘Meet the new Ecuador Ambassador Jaime Marchán-Romero. His principal mission is to get Assange out of the embassy – it has been six years – and although he had been aiming for tomorrow, as I’d just learnt it’s going to take longer. A tad frustrating, but we’ll get there.’

Fidel Narváez was dismissed in the summer of 2018, after eight years of service; late enough to be able to give first-hand information about the increasingly difficult living conditions for Assange in the embassy. The purpose of the instructions received from Quito was clear: to get rid of Assange. To that end, a double strategy was reportedly pursued. Ideally, Assange could be motivated to voluntarily leave the embassy, simply by subjecting him to an increasingly restrictive, hostile and arbitrary environment. Alternatively, the intensity of his suffering would be increased to the point where it might trigger a medical crisis necessitating his transfer to a London hospital, where he could be arrested by British police. It was clear that the envisaged escalation would not materialize overnight, and given Assange’s strong resilience, the strategy might not succeed at all. In that case, Assange’s expulsion would become the only way to end his presence at the embassy, and so the Ecuadorian government started to look for reasons that could be used to publicly justify the termination of his asylum.

As of 28 March 2018, Ecuador begins to increasingly isolate Assange from the outside world. His internet and telephone access are blocked indefinitely, including through the installation of jammers. As has been pointed out, the timing of this measure is hardly a coincidence. It comes less than three weeks after Assange’s secret indictment by the US Department of Justice – a move that the US government had deliberately avoided for eight years. Also, from 28 March to 31 October 2018, Assange’s right to receive private visitors is severely restricted, with the sole exception of meetings with lawyers and doctors. During the entire period, no more than six private visits have been registered – less than one per month. Moreover, from now on, those visitors who are allowed into the embassy will be denied access to Assange’s private rooms. Meetings are now only permitted in a conference room that is monitored through surveillance cameras and hidden microphones. This includes not only meetings with lawyers, politicians or journalists, but also medical examinations and sessions with psychotherapists. Meanwhile, embassy staff and security personnel are instructed to meticulously record anything that can be used against Assange. In the absence of any serious misconduct, they turn to examining Assange’s daily routine under the microscope and painstakingly documenting details such as the feeding times of his cat, the cleanliness of the toilet, and any unwashed dishes in the kitchen sink.

On 14 October 2018, Minister Duncan notes in his diary: ‘The BBC report that Assange’s internet connection has been restored in the Ecuador embassy. The embassy have as good as laid a trap for him. If he misuses it, as he probably will, then they will chuck him out. Let’s see.’ Indeed, in October 2018, some of the previous restrictions are partially relaxed and replaced by a ‘Special Protocol of Visits, Communications and Medical Attention for Mr Julian Paul Assange’. The protocol makes it nearly impossible for Assange not to violate the rules governing his asylum. According to Narváez, the purpose of the protocol is to ‘lay out banana peels all over the floor’, making sure that Assange will repeatedly slip and thus supply excuses for his expulsion by the Ecuadorian government. In particular, the procedure for admitting outside visitors has become more complicated. In some cases, two weeks pass before the necessary permission is granted. Each visit must be justified in writing, with accurate information about the purpose of the visit, the visitor’s current employment situation, and any electronic devices likely to be carried. All visitors must surrender their personal mobile phones while inside the embassy. The same tendency towards arbitrary overregulation can be seen where the protocol addresses medical care, communication devices, and hygiene.

The protocol draws so many lines in the sand that their transgression becomes virtually inevitable. This is the whole point, of course, and so the six-page document concludes with almost gleeful anticipation: ‘Failure to comply with the obligations contained in this Special Protocol by the asylee may result in the termination of diplomatic asylum conceded by the Ecuadorian State, in accordance with the relevant international instruments. The Ecuadorian State reserves itself the right to accept or reject the explanations that Mr. Assange may give in writing regarding the breach of the obligations of this Protocol.’ In other words, it is made crystal clear that any justification or objection Assange may wish to raise in defence of his right to asylum and the prohibition of non-refoulement will not be considered in a due process proceeding based on the rule of law, but will depend entirely on the whim of the government.

Laying down rules that establish a relationship of unilateral dominance, total dependence and unpredictable arbitrariness is a typical feature in the creation of any torturous environment. More specifically, isolating a person from the outside world and positive social contacts, and over-regulating their daily life with complex, meaningless, and arbitrarily interpreted instructions, prohibitions, and procedures, are two key elements routinely used by torturers around the world to undermine the orientation, self-confidence, and resilience of their victims. But Assange’s abuse does not end there.

#### Permanent Surveillance

Already in 2017, surveillance measures inside the embassy are strengthened. The control room in the entrance area, where the security personnel and surveillance monitors are located, disappears behind opaque, one-way ‘spy glass’. For Assange and his visitors, it is no longer possible to see whether and by whom they are being observed. The existing cameras inside the embassy are replaced by newer, high-resolution models. Officially, they do not provide audio recordings. Officially, Assange’s private rooms are also exempt from surveillance. But Assange remains suspicious. He shields documents with his hand while reading or drafting them. He tries to protect the confidentiality of his meetings in the conference room by playing loud music on the radio, switching on his own jamming devices, covering documents, and blinding cameras with bright lights. For the discussion of sensitive legal matters, Assange takes his lawyers to the ladies’ room and turns on the water to generate background noise.

While all of this may look like paranoia, it really was well-founded. In fact, as will be shown, Assange’s surveillance at the embassy is even more systematic and comprehensive than he imagines. Everything is recorded, documented, spied on: medical examinations, strategy meetings with lawyers, meetings with private visitors. Security personnel are as interested in his state of health and his sleep patterns as they are in his personal notes or the SIM cards in his visitors’ mobile phones. Private documents disappear, medical notes are stolen, phones are opened. Microphones are found in the fire extinguisher in the conference room, in electrical outlets and, yes, even in the ladies’ room.

Assange’s son Gabriel, who is born in the spring of 2017, arouses particular interest. Stella Moris and Assange have done their utmost to keep the relationship secret. Assange learns that he will become a father from a note that Moris slips to him during one of her visits. After Gabriel’s birth, it will never be her who brings the infant to the embassy, but a friend who passes him off as his own. As described above, in April 2017 Assange had entrusted his delicate family situation to the Swedish authorities, in the hope of finding a mutual arrangement that would have allowed him to be present at Gabriel’s birth. These were, of course, the same Swedish authorities that had repeatedly demonstrated a complete lack of respect for Assange’s right to privacy, and that the US embassy in Stockholm had described as ‘reliable partners’ in military and civilian intelligence cooperation. Unsurprisingly, therefore, security personnel at the Ecuadorian embassy soon became suspicious and stole one of Gabriel’s nappies to conduct a DNA test.

In 2020, German public broadcaster ARD interviews Leon Panetta – CIA director from 2009 to 2011 and then US defense secretary until 2013 – for their above-mentioned film. Confronted with the alleged surveillance of Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy, Panetta is genuinely amused: ‘It doesn’t surprise me. I mean, that kind of thing goes on all the time. The intelligence business, you know, the name of the game is to get information any way you can. And I’m sure that’s what was involved here.’ At the same time Panetta condemns Assange and WikiLeaks for what he describes as a ‘pretty huge breach of classified information’, and opines that ‘he should be punished’ and ‘face trial’ in order to ‘send a message to others not to do the same thing’. Unlike the CIA, however, WikiLeaks did not obtain any of its information through unlawful methods. No wiretapping, no data theft, no hacking and certainly no torture. Nonetheless, Panetta sees no contradiction in demanding the prosecution of Assange for investigative journalism, while simultaneously tolerating impunity for state-sponsored crimes committed by intelligence agencies. Panetta’s genuine amusement and the almost naïve frankness with which he acknowledges the CIA’s lawlessness are disarmingly honest. Quite evidently, he is already so accustomed to institutionalized criminality that he no longer even perceives it as problematic – a widespread phenomenon among the powerful and privileged of this world.

A key actor directly responsible for the surveillance measures at the Ecuadorian embassy is the Spanish private security company, UC Global. In 2015 it was contracted to guarantee the security of the embassy’s premises and staff, reportedly due to personal contacts with the family of the then Ecuadorian president, Rafael Correa. The owner of UC Global is David Morales, a former Spanish marine. He is behind the massive expansion of Assange’s surveillance. Every day, he personally reviews the material collected by his staff at the embassy. Often, these reports reach him in the United States. Morales’s trips to America have become more frequent since he participated in a security trade fair in Las Vegas in 2016. He receives contracts from a casino empire that is reported to maintain close links with US intelligence services. After his first return from Las Vegas, Morales reportedly makes cryptic remarks to his staff to the effect that ‘we are playing in the big leagues’ and that he had ‘switched to the dark side’ and now worked for their ‘American friends’. Did Morales commit the cardinal sin of any security contractor and turn against the interests of his client? Did he take advantage of his position to monitor Assange and then hand the data over to an American intelligence agency? Was he a double agent?

A criminal trial before the National Court of Justice in Spain aims to shed light on this affair. Assange and his lawyers accuse Morales and UC Global of illegal surveillance and, among other things, violating the confidential attorney–client relationship. Apparently, employees of the company have even attempted to blackmail Assange for large sums of money by threatening to publish material showing him in intimate situations. German journalists of the Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) have also filed criminal reports against UC Global for transgressions against privacy and confidentiality during their visits to Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy.

The Ecuadorian government, now headed by Lenín Moreno, terminates the contract with UC Global in 2018 and hires an Ecuadorian security company by the name of Promsecurity. However, this does not put an end to Assange’s surveillance. Most notably, his meetings with his lawyers continue to be recorded and, in one case, even the documents brought to the embassy by a lawyer are secretly photographed.

In its official responses to my interventions, the Ecuadorian government has always denied spying on Assange. For example, on 26 July 2019, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote, ‘There was no excessive regulation and no recording of private meetings.’ This denial is remarkable, given that some of the resulting video recordings have been extensively shown and commented on in the mass media and continue to be accessible on online platforms such as YouTube. On 2 December 2019, the Ecuadorian government followed up with: ‘Do not forget that the security cameras inside the Embassy were not installed to record Mr Assange, but to monitor the premises of the mission and to protect all those inside, including diplomatic officials.’ This rationale presumably also applies to the microphones in the ladies’ room. Further, ‘Mr Assange and his lawyers and associates made threats and insulting accusations against the Ecuadorian State and its officials in the United Kingdom, accusing them without foundation of espionage for other nations.’ Instead, the Ecuadorian government accuses Assange of making unauthorized recordings in the embassy. On the basis of this one-eyed perception of reality, a constructive dialogue is, of course, almost impossible to achieve.

From a legal perspective, the permanent surveillance of Assange’s conversations with his lawyers and doctors renders any proceedings based on information gathered in this manner irreparably arbitrary. Under these circumstances, the equality of the parties before the law simply can no longer be guaranteed. If UC Global cooperated with an American intelligence service, this would fatally affect not only the Anglo-American extradition proceedings, but also the espionage charges of the US Department of Justice on which the extradition request is based. Quite apart from that, permanent surveillance and the associated constant violation of the right to privacy is also one of the standard components of psychological torture. The targeted person is deliberately deprived of the safe space of privacy, something essential for preserving a sense of personal autonomy, emotional stability and identity. One-way surveillance through cameras, hidden microphones, or spy glass suppresses any possibility of human connection, thus further compounding the ensuing feelings of powerlessness.

#### Defamation, Humiliation and Demonization

From at least mid-2017, Assange lives under constant observation. Every detail of his daily life is pored over and picked apart, and, as always, truth is in the eye of the beholder. Objectively, there are good reasons to see Assange’s resilience and stoic endurance as an impressive feat of resistance. But one can also choose to focus on details that make the scenario look completely different. Not everything about being human is dignified. Some aspects of our lives we prefer to keep private because they are intimate, embarrassing or simply trivial. In the case of Julian Assange, these private aspects increasingly become a topic of public discussion, distortion and humiliation. Ecuadorian officials and political leaders use the disgraceful tool of gossip to launch a new, ‘dirty’ narrative about Assange. Their tone is aggressive, their language immoderate and their aim is to vilify and belittle. The list of Assange’s alleged misconduct is impressive, describing in detail the purportedly unsavoury, inappropriate, and disruptive features of his behaviour. Rhetorically, Assange’s asylum is withdrawn months before he is actually arrested by British police.

In March 2018, after the secret US indictment, Ecuadorian officials begin to intensify their slander campaign and receive zealous support from their British counterparts. On 27 March, Alan Duncan briefs the House of Commons on Assange, saying that ‘It’s about time that this miserable little worm walked out of the embassy and gave himself up to British justice.’ Clearly, public opinion is being groomed across international borders to perceive the impending expulsion and arrest as the logical consequence of a long process of alienation for which Assange himself, and no one else, is to blame.

For any objective observer, the wilful malice of this narrative is easy to detect. Issues that were not considered a problem for years are now suddenly being raised against Assange and cast in the most unfavourable light possible. Everything that can be used against him is exposed, inflated and presented as evidence of a misconduct that can no longer be tolerated. Some of the reproaches are plainly absurd, including claims that he skate-boarded and played soccer inside the embassy. We immediately picture Assange as a rowdy teenager, wearing his baseball cap backwards, kicking penalties in the ambassador’s office and turning the conference room into a halfpipe. The truth is less jolly. In fact, during our medical examination, we found that Assange showed symptoms akin to those of other long-term detainees. Due to the lack of exercise and recreation, their fine motor skills, sense of balance, and physical coordination are insufficiently stimulated, leading to a regressive overall picture. In fact, Assange’s health had already deteriorated to the point where he would have been physically incapable of the escapades he was accused of by the Ecuadorian government. A surveillance video in which he is seen stepping onto a skateboard is still circulating on online platforms such as YouTube. As can be clearly seen, these are not the coordination skills of someone about to wildly skate through the embassy: Assange has trouble keeping his balance even while standing on the board.

Mysteriously, in Assange’s meetings with doctors, lawyers and visitors, his surveillance always seemed to have worked flawlessly, and yet the same sophisticated technology has failed to capture any of the misconduct he is accused of. No photographs or audio/video footage of the alleged soccer games, none of the alleged torture of his cat; none of the alleged smearing of toilet walls with excrement. Nevertheless, these allegations are relentlessly repeated and obediently disseminated by the press until they have taken root in the minds of the public. As a result, when people hear the name ‘Assange’, they no longer think of the war crimes and corruption he exposed, but only of a tragicomic loser they can treat with pity, ridicule, or disdain.

The media hype that was unleashed by the Swedish authorities in August 2010, and which was then fuelled and escalated for years, especially by the British and American press, now reaches its repulsive finale. Like bloodhounds on a wounded animal, his fellow journalists are now pouncing on Assange, attracted by the lumps of slander thrown their way and meting out vicious blows without the slightest sense of human dignity or professional honour. Rarely do these journalists seem to pause and reflect on who is tossing scoops to them like bloody pieces of meat, and what murky interests they are being instrumentalized for.

A particularly telling example is published in the *Daily Mail* on 12 April 2019. It was the day after Assange’s expulsion and arrest by British police – a key moment for the shaping of public opinion. Minister Duncan, who had been in charge of coordinating ‘Operation Pelican’, proudly notes in his diary that he had put the journalist in touch with the Ecuadorian ambassador, ‘thus giving the *Daily Mail* their scoop about the “fetid” Assange hovel’. Indeed, the very headline announces hair-raising revelations: ‘Assange inside his fetid lair: Revealed, the full squalid horror that drove embassy staff to finally kick him out’. And further on, ‘EXCLUSIVE: Photos of Julian Assange’s “dirty protests” have been revealed. He left soiled underpants in the toilet in the Ecuadorian embassy in a fit of rage. On other occasions he left excrement smeared across the wall and ignored warnings not to leave half-eaten meals in the kitchen’. The photos flanking the article, however, show an empty, used plate as well as three used cups in the sink – no trace of ‘half-eaten meals.’ And they show a perfectly clean toilet – no soiled underpants to be seen, let alone excrement.

This is not only how tabloid journalism works, but also – and this is one of the most important insights of my professional life – how human perception works in general. Reading the announcement of something repulsive is enough to trigger our feelings of disgust. We add the dirty details in our own minds, because that is what the text suggests to us. Thus, a photo of a spotless toilet becomes the image of a crime scene where something terrible has happened. As long as we only skim through the article, most of us won’t notice the deception, and Duncan himself notes in his diary: ‘The pictures of his living conditions were beyond repulsive.’ The headline is enough for us to know and, once again, the goal of focusing our attention on Assange’s personality and supposed weaknesses has been achieved. In consequence, Julian Assange is all we are discussing. Some of us despise him, others defend him; and this diversity of opinion is just fine with the governments. Freedom of expression is guaranteed, after all. At least, so long as we discuss only what is served up to us in the headlines. Only when we start choosing for ourselves what we want to discuss and stray into subject areas that the powerful have declared off-limits, only then does our dissent become a ‘conspiracy theory’ and our thirst for knowledge criminal ‘espionage’.

Admittedly, in addition to the aforementioned trivia there are also accusations that seem to be of a more serious character, at least at first glance. They are repeated, almost word for word, in all three official letters I received from the Ecuadorian government. First, the Ecuadorian government keep referring to a scene from the 58th minute of Laura Poitras’s documentary film ‘Risk’. According to the authorities, this scene shows Assange attempting to use his laptop in order to break into the embassy’s computer system and manipulate the surveillance cameras. Now, let us stop and consider for a moment how likely it is that Assange would really allow himself to be filmed by a documentary team while hacking the Ecuadorian computer system. Moreover, the content of the scene is inconsistent with the allegations made by the government. Assange is shown looking at a desktop screen that is placed on the floor, and not at his own laptop, which was visible in another scene a few minutes earlier. According to several separate and unrelated witness testimonies, the scene in question was recorded in 2012, shortly after Assange’s arrival at the embassy, and shows him looking at the embassy’s official surveillance camera monitor in a room that was then being shared by Assange and the security personnel. It can therefore be concluded that the Ecuadorian government’s hacking allegations against Assange are based on an obvious – and arguably intentional – misinterpretation of the relevant footage, which from a legal perspective may well amount to defamation, if not false accusation.

Equally unconvincing is the official interpretation of another incident that allegedly took place on 27 December 2018. According to the Ecuadorian government’s official reply to my office of 26 July 2019, during a conversation with the new ambassador, Assange reportedly said: ‘We are on alert here, with hidden activation measures … we have our finger on the button. We are ready to press it … several buttons (actually). The decision to press the button it will depend on whether we believe that some threats (made against me) are real’ (as translated from the Spanish). From these sentences, the Ecuadorian government constructs another reason for Assange’s expulsion from the embassy: ‘The aforementioned threat is of significant concern to the Ecuadorian State, as it could even allude to a terrorist attack or other violent event that could endanger the lives of officials and third parties in the embassy building.’ While this interpretation may be reasonable in a different context, in the present case it obviously defies common sense. Assange has never been a weapons fanatic, nor has he ever maintained contacts with or expressed sympathies towards terrorist groups or otherwise shown a tendency or inclination to violent crime. Given Assange’s background and work for WikiLeaks, the only ‘buttons’ he could reasonably be referring to are the keys of a computer keyboard. In any case, the alleged statement most likely should be interpreted in a figurative sense as referring to the possible release of leaks. Conversely, it can be excluded with certainty that Assange could have planned the detonation of a bomb, as the Ecuadorian government wanted the world to believe. If the government had even remotely believed in this nonsense, it would not have waited another four months before expelling Assange. Against this background, the Ecuadorian government’s adherence to the claim of a terrorist threat can only be seen as ludicrous.

Apart from hacking and terrorism, the Ecuadorian government also accuses Assange of interference with the internal affairs of other states. In the view of the authorities, Assange has through his political statements disturbed the public peace and violated international agreements of non-intervention. The problem with these accusations is that, from a legal perspective, the principle of non-intervention applies only between sovereign states and cannot be violated by asylum seekers and other private individuals. Clearly, when Assange communicated publicly about the 2016 presidential elections in the United States, about the Catalan secessionist movement in 2017, and many other political issues, he did not do so in the name or on behalf of the Ecuadorian embassy, but in his professional capacity as a publicist, journalist, and political commentator. He simply continued to do his work in line with his right to freedom of expression and press freedom. The same work, of course, that had subjected him to political persecution worldwide and which the previous Ecuadorian government had considered deserving of diplomatic protection. To turn Assange’s journalistic activities, which had been the justification for his asylum, into a justification for his expulsion is not only contrary to good faith, but also incompatible with international human rights law.

Defamation, humiliation and demonization are key elements of psychological torture. Their purpose is not only to destroy the victim’s self-esteem, sense of justice, and trust in the authorities, but also to deprive them of social support within the family, the community, and the broader public, and to trivialize their mis-treatment or make it appear morally justified. As with mobbing victims in their private environment, the resulting feelings of isolation, shame, and hopelessness can push torture victims into nervous breakdowns or cardiovascular collapse, or even to suicide. Mobbing is not a trifle – it is a collective, cumulative form of cruelty. Nor is it torture ‘light’ – it is torture.

#### The United States Manifests as the Mastermind

As of 16 October 2018, at the latest, the question is no longer whether Assange will be expelled from the Ecuadorian embassy, but only when. On that day, Lenín Moreno receives mail from the US House Committee of Foreign Affairs. The letter from the House of Representatives makes clear what course of action is expected in the Assange case: ‘Many of us in the United States Congress are eager to move forward in collaborating with your government on a wide array of issues, from economic cooperation to counternarcotics assistance to the possible return of a United States Agency for International Development mission to Ecuador. However, in order to advance on these crucial matters, we must first resolve a significant challenge created by your predecessor, Rafael Correa – the status of Julian Assange.’

The letter states that ‘Mr. Assange remains a dangerous criminal and a threat to global security, and he should be brought to justice.’ Therefore, the envisaged economic cooperation is made contingent on Ecuador taking a significant step: ‘We are hopeful about developing warmer relations with your government, but feel that it will be very difficult for the United States to advance our bilateral relationship until Mr. Assange is handed over to the proper authorities.’ On 11 December 2018, four senators and two members of Congress follow up in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, referring to Assange’s stay at the embassy and stressing that ‘it is imperative that this situation be resolved swiftly.’

These two letters can be said to formalize the US demand that Ecuador terminate Assange’s asylum. Incidentally, in the coming months, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will have to decide on loans urgently needed by the Ecuadorian government in the amount of $4.2 billion. In the IMF, the United States enjoys veto power and is known to use it very effectively to further its own interests. The resulting pressure on the Moreno government to give in and surrender Assange is enormous, triggering feverish efforts to find reasons that could justify this step in the eyes of the broader public.

In any case, by the time I expressed my alarm at Assange’s mistreatment and summary expulsion from the embassy, the Ecuadorian government was well prepared. Their lengthy responses to my official letters of 18 April, 28 May and 2 October 2019 meticulously listed Assange’s violations of the ‘Special Protocol’ and kept repeating the same accusations of interference in the internal affairs of other states, and of levelling terrorist threats against embassy officials.

While each point indicates the inevitability of Assange’s expulsion, none of them withstands closer scrutiny. The Ecuadorian government even went as far as professing concern that Assange’s health could worsen if he continued to stay at the embassy. In my follow-up letter of 2 October 2019, I rebuked this argument as implausible: ‘It is difficult to see how a genuine concern for Mr. Assange’s health and liberty could justify expelling him from the Ecuadorian Embassy, against his will, without any form of due process, and foreseeably exposing him to a real risk of lifelong arbitrary imprisonment in the United States marked by cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, or even torture.’ Because that is exactly what happened on that morning of 11 April 2019. Of course, there may be situations in which persons can be lawfully deprived of their asylum. But any such decision must necessarily be taken in a due process proceeding subject to the rule of law, including the right to be heard, the right to legal counsel, and the right to appeal to a judicial body.

Assange does not get the benefit of any of these rights. One morning, the Ecuadorian ambassador simply informs him that both his citizenship and his asylum have been revoked and asks him to leave the embassy within the hour. When Assange refuses, British police are invited to enter the embassy and arrest him there. This is a clear breach not only of Ecuadorian constitutional law, which prohibits the extradition of Ecuadorian nationals, but also of fundamental procedural guarantees and of the absolute prohibition of ‘refoulement’ under international law. But the legal intricacies of Assange’s expulsion and arrest do not seem to be of interest to anyone. Therein lies the advantage of unexpected moves: the public is caught off guard and, by the time the media is up to speed, facts have already been established on the ground, and the focus has moved on.

For years Assange has feared the United States would demand his extradition as soon as he were to set foot outside the embassy – and for years he has been ridiculed as paranoid and unreasonable for it. But on the day of his expulsion from the embassy, Assange’s worst nightmare comes true: the United States unseals its secret indictment against him and formally requests his extradition from the United Kingdom. Thus, in terminating Assange’s asylum, the Ecuadorian government knowingly exposes him to the very risk they had referred to seven years earlier as the justification for his diplomatic asylum. In their reply to my office of 18 June 2019, the Ecuadorian government claims not to have known anything of the impending US extradition request: ‘Ecuador was never officially informed of any procedure of extradition or open court case against Mr. Assange outside British or Swedish jurisdiction.’ Forgotten are the ‘constructive discussions’ with Vice-President Pence, forgotten the letter from the US Congress, forgotten the reasons why Ecuador had granted Assange diplomatic asylum in the first place.

After six years and ten months in the Ecuadorian embassy, Assange is stripped of both his Ecuadorian citizenship and his diplomatic asylum, arrested by British police, brought before a British judge, summarily convicted of a criminal offence, and isolated in a high-security prison to await sentencing and the beginning of extradition proceedings initiated by the United States. Assange’s personal belongings, including professional documents and computers, remain in the Ecuadorian embassy. They are not handed over to his lawyers, or to his family, or to the British authorities, but straight to the United States – reportedly in response to a request for mutual legal assistance from the US Department of Justice. Just as with his luggage at Stockholm airport in 2010, Assange’s property is confiscated without due process of law. Should any proof be needed to demonstrate who has really been pulling the strings in the Assange case across all these years and boundaries – here it is.
