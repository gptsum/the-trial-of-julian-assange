### Chapter 2: WikiLeaks’ Role in Society

#### ‘Collateral Murder’: When War Becomes Real

It was only in 2010 that I took proper notice of WikiLeaks: a disclosure platform that obtains classified information from whistleblowers and other sources and guarantees them anonymity, that is, protection from exposure and prosecution. WikiLeaks makes a point of clarifying that, due to an encrypted data transmission technology preventing their tracing, even the organization itself is unable to identify its sources – fully dedicated to the cypher-punk slogan, ‘privacy for the weak, transparency for the powerful.’ Thus, starting in 2006, a publicly accessible archive of previously secret documents was created, and its growing contents soon came to be feared by powerful governments, corporations and organizations. Early revelations exposed, for example, the corruption of the Kenyan government, toxic waste dumping by the Trafigura corporation in Ivory Coast, the methods of Scientology, the US Army’s guidelines for the treatment of Guantánamo detainees, and the dubious business practices of the Swiss bank Julius Baer. First hits, but nothing compared to the overwhelming power of what was to come.

On 5 April 2010, at Washington’s National Press Club, Julian Assange presented ‘Collateral Murder’ to the world. The eighteen-minute video opened with a quote from George Orwell: ‘Political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.’ After that, nothing but disturbing images in black and white. ‘Collateral Murder’ places the viewer inside a US combat helicopter circling at low altitude over a residential area of Baghdad. It is 12 July 2007, just another day in a deplorable war of occupation, the news coverage of which has been dominated almost exclusively by the Western military coalition. Now, suddenly, viewers are immersed onboard the helicopter and see everything from the real-time perspective of the gunner. Radio messages go back and forth. Somewhere on the ground, out of sight, American troops are on the move, and the area is being searched from the air for insurgents and other potential threats.

Suddenly, the helicopter crew reports about twenty men standing about on the road in several small groups. Then they appear on the screen. All of them wear civilian clothing, and most are visibly unarmed. Two of the men have something slung across their shoulders which – judging by shape and size – clearly cannot be rifles. It later turns out that they are journalists carrying photo cameras. Another two men appear to be carrying assault rifles or similar long-barrel firearms. All of the men move around unsuspectingly, talk to each other, some cross the open street – it is obvious that they are not about to take cover or prepare an ambush. Other pedestrians also seem to be going about their everyday business. No one seems to notice the two helicopters. The crew reports over the radio: ‘Have five to six individuals with AK-47s [Kalashnikov-type assault rifles]. Request permission to engage.’ A few seconds later, the permission to open fire arrives, but at the last moment – due to the flight path – a building intrudes between the cannon and the group of people. While the helicopter circles in the distance and moves back into position, a journalist’s raised telephoto lens is mistaken for a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) ready to fire. Shortly thereafter, the line of sight is clear and the gunner opens fire. Ten men are literally mowed down. Some try to escape, but the gunner intercepts them with the next volley. After less than thirty seconds all of them are dead or seriously wounded on the ground. The helicopter continues to circle the attack site, and the troops can be heard commenting: ‘Hahaha, I hit them.’ – ‘Oh yeah, look at those dead bastards.’ – ‘Nice.’ – ‘Good shot.’ – ‘Thank you.’

A few moments later, a seriously wounded man comes into view. He is trying to crawl to safety, but he can hardly move. ‘There’s one guy moving down there but he’s wounded,’ the crew reports. ‘Roger, we’re gonna move down there,’ the ground troops reply. ‘Roger, we’ll cease fire,’ the crew assures in response. Apparently, there was initially every intention of rescuing the injured man, as required by the law of war. Shortly thereafter, the crew reports back: ‘He’s getting up.’ – ‘Maybe he has a weapon down in his hand?’ – ‘No, I haven’t seen one yet.’ The wounded man almost pushes himself up onto his knees, but immediately collapses again. ‘Come on, buddy,’ the gunner comments, aiming the crosshairs at his helpless target. ‘All you gotta do is pick up a weapon.’ But the wounded man won’t do him the favour. It will emerge that he is a forty-year-old Reuters journalist, Saeed Chmagh. Less than a minute later, a civilian minibus appears on the scene, the driver gets out, and, together with two other men, tries to evacuate the wounded man. All three rescuers wear civilian clothing and are clearly unarmed. Agitated, the helicopter crew reports: ‘We have a van approaching … possibly picking up bodies and weapons. Can I shoot?’ A few seconds later comes a clarification request that will be decisive for the legal assessment: ‘Picking up the wounded?’ – ‘Yeah, we’re trying to get permission to engage.’ – ‘Come on, let us shoot!’ The wounded man is being carried to the minibus. Then, authorization to open fire is given, and the minibus is literally shot to pieces with the helicopter’s 30-mm gun. The driver and the two other rescuers are killed instantly. His five-year-old daughter and ten-year-old son are seriously injured in the back seat of the minibus. They reportedly had been on their way to school with their father. Chmagh himself dies from his injuries shortly afterwards – he, too, a father of four. The soldiers congratulate each other once again on a job well done, as if it were a team sport. When the ground troops arrive on the scene and report that a child has been wounded, the crew only comments, ‘Ah, damn. Oh well.’ And then, after a pause that must have been weighed down by heavy doubt: ‘Well, it’s their fault for bringing their kids into a battle.’ – ‘That’s right.’ According to US military officials, an AK-47 assault rifle, an RPG rocket launcher with two grenades, and the cameras of the two killed Reuters journalists are later found at the scene.

#### ‘Collateral Murder’ – A War Crime?

Whether the conduct shown in the ‘Collateral Murder’ video amounts to a war crime, and who bears personal responsibility for it, should be for a court of law to decide. However, given that no such judicial assessment has ever taken place, the question rightly arises as to how this omission by the US authorities should be classified. Was it that lawful acts of war had been taken out of context and unfairly dramatized by WikiLeaks? Or were the US authorities indeed responsible for covering up a murder? When, in the following, I provide my personal views on this question, I am not concerned with determining the criminal culpability or innocence of individual soldiers. Rather, I would like to raise the question of the government’s good faith right from the outset and sharpen the reader’s eye for it. For the question of the good faith of public authorities runs like a red thread through the entire Assange case, and, even in complex circumstances, always provides external observers with reliable, objective guidance.

When I comment on the ‘Collateral Murder’ video from the perspective of the law of war, I am not infallible, of course, but I do so nonetheless with a certain amount of expertise and experience. As a former legal advisor and delegate to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and as a professor of international law, I have spent more than twenty years intensively studying the practice of the law of war, particularly the rules governing the use of force during military engagements. I have analysed hundreds of operations, both on paper and on the ground in various contexts of war. I have not only written books and academic articles on the subject, I have also seen the destruction and suffering of war with my own eyes and have spoken with the responsible operational forces and politicians as well as with witnesses, survivors, and relatives of victims. And I have led a seven-year international expert process for the ICRC, clarifying the conditions under which civilians lose their protection under the law of war and become legitimate military targets – the key question arising in a legal analysis of ‘Collateral Murder’.

The basic rules of the law of war relevant to this case sound simple: Soldiers and other combatants may be attacked, civilians may not. Once combatants have fallen ‘out of combat’ due to wounds or for other reasons, they may no longer be attacked, but must be collected and cared for regardless of their legal status or affiliation. Civilians may lose their protection only if and for such time as they directly participate in hostilities. Also protected are medical and rescue personnel who are not themselves actively participating in hostilities, whether they are civilians or members of enemy forces. They may even carry pistols, assault rifles and other light weapons for purposes of self-defence and the protection of the wounded. Rescue personnel may also collect and transport the personal weapons of wounded combatants evacuated by them, provided such weapons are no longer used in combat. In all these cases, any person must be presumed to be protected in case of doubt and, therefore, may be attacked only once it is clear that the required legal criteria are fulfilled: either combatant status or direct participation in hostilities – in military parlance, this is called ‘positive identification’ (PID). Now that we have established the basics of the law of war, let us take another look at ‘Collateral Murder’.

The operational context is that two Apache attack helicopters are searching from the air for insurgents that might attack their ground forces. Contrary to what the image resolution might suggest, the helicopters are not circling a mere 300 feet above the scene, but at a distance of approximately one mile, and the screen image is captured through a highly sensitive and automatically controlled telephoto lens. This means that the soldiers cannot just take a quick look through the window to pick up additional details, but must rely on the screen image and, moreover, interpret it in real time. Unlike us, they do not have the luxury of repeatedly reviewing the same scenes, but have to make split-second decisions as to whether they have identified a threat to ground troops that needs to be neutralized. The permissibility of an attack must therefore always be judged by what can and must reasonably be expected of a soldier acting correctly under the prevailing circumstances.

Now, the operation is not taking place above an open battlefield, but above a residential district of Baghdad: a densely populated area where most of the population necessarily consists of protected civilians. As can be seen from the length and contrast of the shadows on the ground, it is broad daylight and visibility is clear. There are no armed confrontations in progress, and no curfew appears to have been imposed. In an environment like this and at this time of day, the soldiers must expect to see civilians out on the street everywhere. Since the US-British invasion, public order in Iraq has largely broken down. Because of the constant threat of looting, the American occupation forces in 2003 explicitly authorized Iraqi civilians to possess assault rifles for crime prevention purposes. By 2007, Kalashnikovs were so widespread in Iraqi private households that even the public carrying of a few isolated weapons, without more, could not be interpreted as an expression of ‘hostile intent’. While this admittedly does not apply to RPG rocket launchers, in the present case, the ‘permission to engage’ clearly had been given already on the basis of the – rather casual – suspicion of ‘five to six persons with AK-47s’. Only the confusion of a camera with a rocket launcher, which occurred after the authorization to open fire, could potentially be interpreted as an honest – albeit mistaken – identification of a ‘hostile intent’. But even this alleged rocket launcher is nowhere in sight at the moment of the attack, and neither is the assault rifle. In the given circumstances there is obviously no risk of an imminent attack on the helicopter or the ground troops, and the status of the targeted men is doubtful at best. Consequently, there is no basis for claiming the positive identification of a legitimate target or imminent threat as required for a lawful attack. In this situation, any law-abiding shooter would have to at least pause and try to get a clearer picture. The fact that, instead, ten evidently unarmed men are massacred can at best be considered a reckless, unprofessional and irresponsible mistake – true to the slogan ‘shoot first, ask questions later’. At worst, this stage of the attack already amounts to the deliberate killing of presumably protected persons and, thus, already constitutes a war crime.

If the first attack was reckless at best, the second is criminal without question. As the radio transmissions show, the soldiers are fully aware that they cannot lawfully attack the wounded Chmagh. But they are clearly looking for a pretext, almost begging him to reach for a weapon, that would allow them to shoot him. As soldiers deployed in a war context, they must know that medical personnel and other non-combatant rescuers are protected under the law of war, regardless of any official identification or affiliation with a medical service. In the present case, it is obvious that Chmagh’s unarmed rescuers are only concerned with life-saving measures. Under the law of war, the rescue of the wounded cannot be considered a ‘hostile act’ even when – unlike here – their personal weapons are also collected in the process. In any case, American ground forces would arrive on the scene moments later and could easily have brought the situation under control. Against this undisputed factual background, the attack on the wounded Chmagh and his rescuers cannot be qualified as a negligent error but amounts to a deliberate war crime.

The soldiers knew it, their commanders knew it, and so did the US Department of Defense. The fact that the internal investigation conducted by US Army command nonetheless concluded that the soldiers had acted in compliance with the laws of war and declared case closed without any criminal prosecution of the perpetrators, let alone any compensation payments to the surviving relatives, is deeply disturbing. By taking this path, the superiors in charge not only became personally complicit in a war crime; they also betrayed the law of their own country, the reputation of their own armed forces, and the trust and security of their own people. Had the US government had its way, the American public would never have known about this murder, because the video was destined to vanish forever into the black hole of state secrets. Just like the ‘Pentagon Papers’ that exposed the government’s deliberate deception of the American public during the Vietnam War. Just like the torture videos that CIA director Gina Haspel ordered to be destroyed while she was still commanding an American ‘black site’ in Thailand. Just like the unpublished photos from Abu Ghraib prison, which reportedly show the sadistic torture, rape and humiliation of defenceless prisoners in repulsive detail. Just like the full US Senate committee report, which over 7,000 pages exposes the personal and institutional responsibilities for the CIA’s systematic torture practices.

None of this may lawfully be disclosed to the American public, and certainly not to the entire world. For the chain of criminal responsibility for these offences does not end with the lower ranks of those doing the dirty work, but leads to finely furnished offices with thick carpets. So the public is shamelessly lied to. Officially, this secrecy aims to protect ‘national security’ and ‘decent men and women in uniform’, not to ensure the impunity of murderers, torturers, rapists and – above all – their superiors. Officially, it is the whistleblowers exposing war crimes who are called ‘traitors to the country’, not the war criminals and their superiors. Officially, it is the journalists publishing evidence for war crimes who are accused of acting ‘irresponsibly’, not the secretive authorities suppressing such evidence. Officially, any proven perpetrators are described as isolated ‘bad apples’, not as scapegoats for systemic shortcomings. The public at large happily swallows the official narrative, because acknowledging the reality of a broader systemic failure would be too threatening, too unsettling, too much work. It is this tendency towards lethargy, conformity, and self-deception which is responsible for the failure of what arguably is the most famous WikiLeaks slogan: ‘If wars can be started by lies, they can be ended by the truth.’ Unfortunately, as a general rule, the problem is not that we do not know the truth, but that we do not want to know it.

#### On the Difference between Confidentiality and Secrecy

‘Collateral Murder’ shook up world public opinion. The video gives but a glimpse of the daily slaughter in the Iraq War, yet makes it almost unbearably real. Every second of the clip virtually screams at us: Look, this is the real face of war. From now on, you can’t say you didn’t know. From now on you are informed and, therefore, also responsible for what your government does with your tax money. Gone are the days when you were still able to blindly believe the official narratives disseminated at press conferences, on government websites, and in Sunday speeches.

But ‘Collateral Murder’ was just the beginning of a veritable flood of WikiLeaks revelations still to be published in 2010. In accomplishing the task, Assange cooperated with prestigious daily and weekly newspapers, most notably the *New York Times*, the *Guardian*, *Der Spiegel*, *Le Monde* and *El País*. The sheer volume of the material to be processed required the support of professional journalistic organizations: 90,000 documents with field reports from the Afghanistan War, several hundred thousand from the Iraq War and, starting from November, a quarter of a million diplomatic cables sent by US embassy employees in just about every country in the world. Importantly, on Assange’s instructions, all these publications were preceded by a rigorous ‘harm reduction’ process in which names of potentially endangered persons were individually censored. Thus, when the ‘Afghan War Diary’ was published in July 2010, Assange withheld some 15,000 documents in order to give the US government and the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) time to identify sensitive data that needed to be redacted. It was only one year later, after the publication by two *Guardian* journalists of the password to original unredacted documents, encrypted by WikiLeaks, that Assange decided to also publish the relevant documents in unredacted form himself. We will discuss this in more detail at a later stage.

Personally, I took note of the WikiLeaks publications at the time, of course. But I was not as shocked by their contents as the general public was, because much of it – and then some – I already knew. For more than a decade, I had been dealing with the reality of war day in, day out at the ICRC and had also experienced it in my own flesh and soul in the Balkans, the Middle East, and Afghanistan. When WikiLeaks broke the silence, I felt a sense of relief. Finally, I thought, something would change, and the world would no longer be able to look the other way.

At the ICRC, we always treated the information we collected with strict confidentiality. This was a matter of life and death – both for the war victims and for us. In a war context, there is little protection. There are no police enforcing law and order, and witnesses to war crimes are a nuisance that can be easily eliminated. So, unless all warring parties can be certain that the ICRC will not go public with its information, it would simply be impossible for the organization to carry out its humanitarian mission deep inside zones of conflict. That is why ICRC staff are explicitly exempted from testifying before the International Criminal Court in The Hague. There is no viable alternative to this exemption because, once an ICRC delegate testifies in a war crimes trial, warring parties worldwide would immediately question whether they could continue to grant the organization access to prisoners of war and civilian war victims, and whether delegates who already ‘know too much’ should perhaps be made to suffer some ‘tragic accident’ rather than allowing them to escape with their knowledge. Beyond strict respect for confidentiality, constant communication also had to be maintained with all parties to the conflict. Thus, in Afghanistan, the address books of our phones not only listed the mobile numbers of ISAF commanders, but also those of Taliban leaders. Every movement outside the capital had to be coordinated with all concerned parties, every change in the situation had to be detected, reported and assessed. After all, too many colleagues had already paid the ultimate price for their humanitarian mission – whether in the Hindu Kush, the Congo or Chechnya. The resulting golden rule for our public communication was: ‘We say what we do, but not what we see.’

This is not to say that, in our confidential dialogue with the warring parties, we limited ourselves to diplomatic niceties. On the contrary, thanks to the confidentiality of our exchange, we could communicate openly and clearly and, if necessary, could even play hardball at times. We always had to strike a delicate balance between uncompromising toughness and pragmatic realism. Whenever we noticed that the authorities exploited our commitment to confidentiality as cover for their own inaction, we would very quickly move the dialogue on to the next hierarchical level, all the way up to the state leadership. If that also failed, we began to involve friendly third countries – still on a confidential basis. Our last resort, the public press release, was used extremely rarely, usually after years of unsuccessful work behind the scenes.

What, then, is the difference between confidentiality and secrecy? To put it simply, secrecy not only withholds certain facts from public knowledge, but also removes those facts from judicial oversight and potential sanctions. It creates a legal vacuum. I have worked for well over two decades inside the international system, and I have come to the conclusion that this type of secrecy, which shields entire areas of state activity from the purview of the public, is neither necessary nor acceptable. There can be no justification ever for exempting any sphere of governance from public knowledge and oversight. Doing so always opens the door to abuse and inevitably leads to cover-ups for crimes, exploitation and corruption.

What we do need, however, is confidentiality, both in a diplomatic and in an individual sense. Diplomatic confidentiality creates a protected framework for negotiations, inspections and other confidence-building measures aimed at de-escalating tensions and maintaining or restoring a lawful situation. If this goal cannot be achieved within a reasonable time frame, then diplomatic confidentiality loses its justification and can easily turn into secrecy and complicity. We also need individual confidentiality, such as privacy, source protection, and personality rights – all of which have nothing to do with secrecy and do not exempt the protected individual from oversight and accountability under the law.

I believe we are generally too optimistic about our own ability to behave lawfully without oversight in the long term. As human beings, we are all primarily driven by perceived short-term self-interest. This is an expression of our neurobiological and psychosocial nature and manifests regardless of status and education, over and above cultural, religious, or ideological factors. It is therefore not a moral question, but a scientific fact that must be duly taken into account when shaping our legal, political and economic governance systems. Basic constitutional principles such as democracy, the separation of powers and the rule of law, for example, reflect a realistic assessment of our inherently limited ability to faithfully exercise governmental power entrusted to us without effective constraints and oversight.

But the constitutional codification and institutional implementation of such basic principles is not sufficient to mitigate the weaknesses of human nature. Even if we are fortunate enough to live in a democracy, our electoral and legislative processes are already so distorted by campaign financing and lobbying schemes that the legitimate interests of the voting population hardly ever find genuine representation. The rule of law, in turn, can only be effective if the executive branch is properly subject to independent and impartial judicial oversight. In reality, however, the rifts separating the three branches of government are always far shallower than those separating the authorities of all three branches from the general population. Officials know each other personally, have lunch together, value good relations, share information, consult informally, and avoid stabbing one another in the back – in other words, they behave exactly as decent people are expected to behave. In practice, though, their mutual impartiality has already been largely undermined. In the context of daily administrative routine, this phenomenon tends to be harmless and can even help to avoid bureaucratic inefficiencies. However, as soon as the reputation and essential interests of influential stakeholders are concerned, it almost always causes collusion, corruption, and system failure, up to and including the worst of crimes – the ‘banality of evil’, as Hannah Arendt so aptly put it.

As a result of the failure or deliberate obstruction of the US military’s oversight mechanisms, the war crime documented in ‘Collateral Murder’ was never prosecuted or compensated. Several US Iraq veterans subsequently confirmed that the operation in question was not a singular exception and that such massacres were commonplace at the time, without anyone ever being held to account. The resulting impunity has consolidated a culture of tolerance towards violent crime that has become almost impossible to correct. The appalling sense of entitlement with which the defenceless African American George Floyd was publicly choked to death by police officers in Minneapolis on 25 May 2020 is the direct consequence of decades of American leniency towards its own criminals in uniform. The same misguided policy is also reflected in the aggressive stance of the US towards the International Criminal Court and its employees – as if war crimes could ever be undone by the suppression of evidence and the intimidation of judges. As I have stressed in my annual report to the General Assembly in 2021 (A/76/168), the only way to end collusion and impunity is through strict transparency and systematic enforcement of personal and institutional accountability. This, of course, is precisely the political agenda of WikiLeaks.

#### WikiLeaks as a Safety Valve

In my view, WikiLeaks can be described as a societal safety valve. When an employee working for a government or corporation witnesses wrongdoing, they may initially look the other way. If the misconduct is serious enough, their silence will eventually give rise to an unbearable moral dilemma, until they conclude: I can’t take it anymore, I can’t keep my knowledge to myself, I need to find a way to free myself of this moral burden. If the government or corporation fail to offer internal structures and procedures through which such legal and moral grievances can be adequately remedied, then eventually the pressure grows too great and blows the alarm whistle on the safety valve: the employee literally becomes a ‘whistleblower’. WikiLeaks provides a mechanism that guarantees such whistleblowers absolute anonymity.

Thus, through the safety valve of WikiLeaks, information finds its way to the public. Unlike traditional journalism, such information is minimally edited. Contrary to what is often claimed, information that could expose individuals to danger, and which is not otherwise publicly available, is redacted by WikiLeaks. Everything else is generally made available in the form of unredacted originals. In 2010, the media partners associated with WikiLeaks provided valuable support in separating public interest information from trivialities. At the same time, it also became apparent that traditional journalism no longer fulfilled the indispensable societal functions of the ‘Fourth Estate’: monitoring the checks and balances between the branches of government, informing the public about systemic shortcomings and their implications for the average citizen and, thus, enabling the latter to take the necessary remedial action through the democratic process.

Even an organization committed to full transparency must, of course, act responsibly. It must be emphasized, however, that the US government has never offered any evidence for its claim that people have been endangered by the WikiLeaks disclosures. In fact, in 2010, then US vice-president Joe Biden even acknowledged during a session of the UN Security Council that WikiLeaks’ publications had caused ‘no substantive damage’ other than being ‘embarrassing’ for the US government. In reality, of course, these leaks were far beyond embarrassing – they endangered the impunity of officials at all levels of the chain of command for war crimes, torture and corruption.

Like any safety valve, WikiLeaks is not the problem, but merely a visible symptom of more deep-rooted shortcomings. The real problem is always the crimes – not the fact that they are being revealed. And yet precisely the contrary is being communicated to the public. By its very existence, WikiLeaks calls into question an entire governance system based on secrecy, a way of doing business that has become deeply entrenched: secret diplomatic notes, blurred lines between private and public interests, routine corruption, cronyism and abuse of power.

Had the crimes revealed by WikiLeaks been prosecuted and redressed in good faith, it might then have been possible and appropriate to initiate a balanced discussion about the accountability of whistleblowers and journalists. But when murderers, torturers and their superiors go unpunished, whereas non-violent truth-tellers like Chelsea Manning, Julian Assange and Edward Snowden are prosecuted and threatened with sanctions normally reserved for perpetrators of the most serious crimes, then any presumption of good faith on the part of the authorities has been effectively disproved.

Democratically elected governments unwilling to be held accountable for crimes and misconduct fear nothing more than the unrestrained transparency promoted by WikiLeaks. Hence their excessively aggressive reaction and the ferocity with which people like Manning, Assange and Snowden are being persecuted. None of this is happening because of any real-world harm caused by these dissidents. After all, no one was seriously endangered, no government went bankrupt, and no war was lost. The only real threat posed by WikiLeaks is that it challenges the impunity of the powerful. In order to prevent this idea from spreading through the establishment of a second, third, or hundredth WikiLeaks, potential emulators must be intimidated worldwide. This is why the methodology of WikiLeaks is persecuted and punished in the person of Assange. The spotlight no longer illuminates the official misconduct revealed by WikiLeaks but is pointed exclusively at the messenger. He is declared a rapist, a hacker, a spy and a narcissist who is trying to evade justice and is not entitled to the protections of press freedom. Obediently, public opinion follows the guiding spotlight and discusses avidly and freely – about Julian Assange, his cat and his skateboard. To some he is a hero, to others a villain. But to the powerful, this question is irrelevant. To them, only one thing matters: that the real elephant in the room, their own dirty secrets, has been successfully blanked out and vanished back into the darkness of our collective amnesia.
