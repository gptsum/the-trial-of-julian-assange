### Chapter 7: Anglo-Swedish Extradition Trial

#### Sweden Refuses to Offer a Non-Refoulement Guarantee

From Berlin, Assange travels on to London. Meanwhile, for Prosecutor Ny, getting him back to Sweden for questioning has suddenly become a matter of utmost urgency. Assange, too, is keen for an opportunity to be heard by the Swedish authorities and willing to return to Stockholm at his own expense. Already on 30 September, three days after his departure from Sweden, his lawyer Björn Hurtig informs Deputy Director of Public Prosecution Erika Lejnefors that Assange is currently abroad, but that an interview with him can be scheduled as early as 10 October 2010 – a Sunday – or any other day of her choice in the following week from 11 to 15 October. Lejnefors declines to schedule an interview on a Sunday, because this would involve police officers working on the weekend. And the week immediately following that Sunday is vetoed by Director of Public Prosecution Marianne Ny personally, apparently because it is ‘too far ahead’.

In her submission of 24 November 2010 to the Svea Court of Appeal, Prosecutor Ny will insist that during this period ‘we were extremely anxious to interview him’. However, for more than one month, while Assange was still in Sweden, his right to be heard and to defend himself was consistently denied, despite extremely damaging rape allegations unlawfully leaked by the Swedish Prosecution Authority. And now that he had to travel from abroad in order to be questioned in Sweden, prepared to pay his own way and to make himself available for an entire week, the prosecutor categorically refused to schedule an interview anytime in the proposed period of 11–15 October, purportedly because she could not wait for as little as ten days. As we will see, her ‘anxiety to interview Assange’ would not prevent her from putting off that very interview for another six years while at the same time professing indignation over A. and S. being denied justice.

In truth, of course, Assange’s unexpected offer to return to Sweden so quickly must have been very inconvenient. It clearly did not fit the carefully constructed official narrative of the ‘fugitive rapist’ to see him voluntarily return to Stockholm and respond to the allegations against him. So, when the authorities received intelligence that Assange planned to give a lecture in Stockholm on 4 October, they changed their plans, and instead arranged for him to be arrested in a police raid at the venue. In order to secure the desired media coverage of this spectacular arrest, the press had been proactively alerted. The trap remained unsuccessful – Assange did not come to Sweden on 4 October.

So far, both Assange and his lawyer had interpreted Prosecutor Ny’s relaxed manner as indicating that she intended to close the investigation without even bothering to interview him. From a procedural perspective, this seems to be the only good-faith explanation for consistently declining to take Assange’s statement and refusing to provide his lawyer with even the most basic information about the precise allegations made against him. But with her obstructive approach becoming increasingly obvious, Assange begins to grow suspicious. Around the same time, reports multiply of a US Grand Jury working on a secret indictment against Assange. In view of the accumulating irregularities in the Swedish proceedings and the country’s subservient proximity to US intelligence services, Assange fears, not unreasonably, that Sweden might surrender him to the United States without any form of due process, as it did with Agiza and Al Zery a few years earlier. To allay these concerns, Assange wants a guarantee: the Swedish authorities should issue a written assurance that were he to return to Sweden, he would not be extradited onwards to the United States, where he could expect an unfair trial for espionage and inhumane conditions of detention. Assange’s request is straightforward, but the response he receives is evasive in the extreme. According to the Swedish authorities, no guarantee of non-extradition can be given so long as the United States has not made an extradition request. Moreover, extradition decisions are a judicial matter for the courts, in which the government cannot interfere. After all, Sweden is a constitutional democracy governed by the rule of law!

While this response may seem convincing at first glance, it has no basis in either law or practice. In reality, such ‘diplomatic assurances’ are a standard instrument of international relations and are widely used around the world, especially in connection with the extradition and deportation of foreigners. The extraditing or deporting state requests written assurances from the destination or transit state that the person to be extradited will not be executed, tortured or otherwise mistreated under any circumstances, that their procedural rights are guaranteed and that – in accordance with the universal principle of non-refoulement – they will not be extradited to a third state in which their human rights protection is not guaranteed. In practice, such non-refoulement guarantees are routinely given, naturally without requiring a prior extradition request by the potentially unsafe third state. Likewise, the all-time favourite smokescreen advanced by Western democracies trying to evade their human rights obligations, namely that the government cannot ‘interfere’ with pending judicial proceedings, does not stand up to scrutiny. In Sweden, as in most other countries, the government has the prerogative to refuse any extradition on political grounds, irrespective of whether it has been approved by the judiciary. Clearly, the reasons why Sweden consistently declined to offer Assange a guarantee of non-refoulement were not constitutional, but purely political, and Assange had every reason to be concerned, particularly given the longstanding – and unconstitutional – collusion between Stockholm and Washington in matters of national security and intelligence, which WikiLeaks itself had exposed to the world. This is why, on 8 October and 12 November 2010, Assange’s lawyer Hurtig proposes to the Swedish Prosecution Authority that Assange be questioned by phone or video conference, on the basis of applicable international mutual legal assistance agreements. In the alternative, he offers that Assange would also be prepared to provide a statement in writing or to attend an interview in person at the Australian Embassy. As expressly acknowledged in the ‘Agreed Statement of Facts and Issues’ before the British Supreme Court, all of these possibilities are permitted in Swedish law. Nevertheless, all of them are declined as ‘inappropriate’ by the Swedish Prosecution Authority, Prosecutor Ny insisting that Assange be interviewed in person in Sweden.

#### Sweden Refuses to Interview Assange in London

On 18 November 2010, Marianne Ny requests and receives a detention order in absentia from the Stockholm District Court, which is confirmed by the Appeals Court on 24 November. On this basis, the prosecutor issues a European Arrest Warrant against Assange. Officially, this is nothing but a logical consequence of his alleged attempt to evade justice for sexual offences by ‘fleeing’ from Sweden to the United Kingdom. Ny wants Assange to be arrested in London and subsequently extradited to Sweden. At her request, Interpol further issues a ‘red notice’ for Assange – a level of worldwide police alert usually reserved for internationally wanted fugitives formally indicted or convicted of a crime. But Assange has been neither indicted nor convicted. He is a cooperative suspect in a preliminary investigation, who has been keen to respond to the rape allegations against him ever since they were illegally leaked by the authorities on 20 August 2010, but who is not prepared to risk his irregular rendition to the United States. On the day of his arrest, the US consultancy firm Stratfor will note: ‘Charges of sexual assault rarely are passed through Interpol red notices, like this case, so this is no doubt about trying to disrupt WikiLeaks release of government documents.’ Indeed, Prosecutor Ny’s decision comes exactly ten days before the planned and announced release of CableGate on 28 November – a truly monumental leak, of global proportions, which has a terrified US Government desperately scrambling for damage control. A mere coincidence? Certainly not.

The director of public prosecution knows, of course, that her aggressive action will foment another media hype and further damage Assange’s reputation, not only in the eyes of the public, but also in the eyes of all the governments that are about to be embarrassed by the release of a quarter of a million US diplomatic cables. As an experienced prosecutor, she also knows that her approach is grossly disproportionate in this case. After all, Assange had clearly cooperated and even repeatedly requested to be interviewed throughout his stay in Sweden; he had expressly requested and received authorization to leave Sweden; he had offered to return to Sweden for an interview on any day from 10 to 15 October 2010; had repeated that offer for a later date on the condition of a non-refoulement’ guarantee and, alternatively, was willing to be interviewed through mutual legal assistance in London or by phone or video conference.

A former Swedish judge, Britta Sundberg-Weitman sees this as a clear breach of the principle of proportionality enshrined in European law, which stipulates that public authorities may interfere with individual rights only to the extent necessary and justified to achieve a legitimate purpose. It remains a mystery not only to Sundberg-Weitman why Marianne Ny refused to question Assange personally in London, or by telephone or videoconference, when both would have been possible without any problems under existing mutual legal assistance agreements. Former Swedish prosecutor Sven-Erik Alhem goes a step further: ‘In my view, only when it was first shown that it would be impossible to get [Assange] interrogated in England by using Mutual Legal Assistance from England, should an application for an EAW have been submitted. Since I understand that he has been willing to be interviewed by these means since leaving Sweden, I regard the prosecutor’s refusal to at least try to interview him as being unreasonable and unprofessional, as well as unfair and disproportionate.’

In January 2011, Björn Hurtig tries to put pressure on Prosecutor Ny to question his client in London. Her response, which she sends to Hurtig by SMS text message on 11 January at 10:58 a.m., is succinct: ‘Hi! For investigative reasons, a request for legal assistance for questioning in England is not relevant. Best regards, Marianne Ny.’ In an earlier press interview of 5 December 2010, she had even falsely claimed that Swedish law prevented her from interviewing Assange in London. According to Britta Sundberg-Weitman, ‘This is clearly not true.’ Sven-Erik Alhem comments that there is ‘nothing in Swedish law that I know of to prevent a prosecutor from seeking mutual legal assistance to have a suspect interviewed’. The same is later confirmed in the ‘Agreed Statement of Facts and Issues’ before the British Supreme Court. Defence counsel Hurtig refuses to give up and, on 9 February 2011, submits a complaint to the Swedish prosecutor-general asking for a legal review of Ny’s refusal to question Assange in London. But instead of adjudicating the matter himself, the prosecutor-general refers it back to Ny, asking her to treat Hurtig’s complaint as a request for reconsideration. On 14 February 2011, Prosecutor Ny then comes to the unsurprising conclusion that she can find no reason to revise her own decision: ‘The interview planned with Assange must take place in Sweden for investigative reasons. These include, among other things, that the interview with Assange must be conducted in the same manner as the interviews with other persons in this investigation and that these interviews are likely to lead to further investigative measures.’ This is a rather brazen justification given that the initial interviews with most witnesses and one of the alleged victims had been conducted by phone, whereas Assange had personally come to the police station for questioning on 30 August 2010.

#### Assange’s First Arrest and Release on Bail

Meanwhile, Assange continues to work from London. In late autumn 2010, he prepares the two largest WikiLeaks releases so far, again in collaboration with some of the world’s most prominent newspapers and magazines. On the evening of 22 October, WikiLeaks releases the Iraq War Logs: almost 400,000 American logs covering the Iraq War from 2004 to 2009 and providing an undistorted chronicle of an unlawful war of aggression. Suddenly, everything is out in the open: page after page, log after log, the entire world can read what really happened during six years of ‘Operation Iraqi Freedom’. WikiLeaks offers an inside view of a war whose true horrors have been largely concealed or whitewashed by official US statements. The documented atrocity condenses, as it so often does, into unbearable figures: by the end of 2009, the Iraq War has already claimed at least 109,032 deaths, including more than 66,000 Iraqi civilians. At the same time, it is revealed that the United States knowingly exposed thousands of detainees to torture and abuse, abandoning them in the hands of Iraqi security forces and ordering US forces not to investigate such crimes.

With these disclosures, WikiLeaks put a harsh and definite end to any humanitarian myths that may still have lingered about the Iraq War. On 26 October, the then UN high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, called for investigation and punishment of the documented human rights violations, and even the US government did not dispute the veracity of the material. Remarkably, to date, WikiLeaks does not appear to have published a single document that was falsified or even questionable in its authenticity – not a claim many media organizations can make.

Four weeks later, CableGate marks the third and final phase in the journalistic processing of the material leaked by Chelsea Manning. This time, the focus is on US diplomacy. In the last forty-eight hours before the publication begins, an important correspondence takes place between Assange, US Ambassador Susman in London and the US State Department in Washington. On 26 November, Assange asks the US government to alert WikiLeaks to ‘any specific instances (record numbers or names) where it considers the publication of information would put individual persons at significant risk of harm that has not already been addressed’; he assures it that ‘WikiLeaks will respect the confidentiality of advice provided by the United States Government and is prepared to consider any such submissions without delay.’ However, in his response on 27 November, State Department Legal Advisor Harold Koh makes clear that ‘we will not engage in a negotiation regarding the further release or dissemination of illegally obtained US Government classified materials.’ On the following day, 28 November 2010, WikiLeaks and its publication partners – the *Guardian*, the *New York Times*, *El País*, *Der Spiegel*, and *Le Monde* – begin the process of publishing what will add up to over 250,000 classified pieces of US diplomatic correspondence.

Importantly, despite the US government’s refusal to cooperate in the redaction of these documents, WikiLeaks and its publication partners conduct a rigorous ‘harm reduction’ process in which every single document is reviewed, and any information is redacted that could have exposed individuals to risk. Initially, only documents that have been selected and redacted by journalists of the aforementioned newspapers are made available on the WikiLeaks website. Contrary to common assumptions, Assange decides to publish the unredacted CableGate materials only nine months later, on 1 September 2011, after they have already been made publicly accessible by combining information published by two *Guardian* journalists and the German weekly *Der Freitag*. Assange tries in vain to convince *Der Freitag* not to publish the relevant information, precisely because he is worried about potentially ensuing risks for certain individuals mentioned by name in the unredacted documents. When *Der Freitag* nevertheless insists on publishing the scoop in late August 2011, Assange alerts the US government in advance, makes clear that this publication would occur without the consent or control of WikiLeaks, and engages with US officials to try and ensure proper harm reduction. We will return to this issue in more detail later.

CableGate comprises primarily confidential diplomatic correspondence between the US State Department and US embassies in various countries. Intended exclusively for internal consumption, the tone of this correspondence is often unvarnished and devoid of diplomacy. The content of the cables ranges from gossip and discourteous portraits of foreign officials to sober assessments of international conflicts, but also includes evidence of collusion between the United States and its allies in extraordinary rendition and torture, as well as other machinations of US power politics. For example, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s secret ‘national human intelligence collection directive’ instructed US diplomats to collect intelligence on top UN officials, including biographic and biometrical data, credit cards, passwords and personal encryption keys used for official communications. Other examples include the Swedish government’s extensive civilian and military intelligence collusion with the United States, which was deliberately kept secret from the Swedish parliament and public.

Never before have a government’s diplomatic practices been exposed on such a scale. For the US government, the reputational damage inflicted by CableGate and the accompanying media coverage is immense. As can be seen from the immediate reactions, the United States feels not only embarrassed, but increasingly powerless and threatened. The long arm of the US government ensures that WikiLeaks comes under serious pressure: its website becomes the target of cyberattacks, Amazon cancels important server capacity rented by the organization, its accounts are blocked, and credit companies as well as financial service providers terminate their cooperation. But the primary target remains Assange. He is the visible head of WikiLeaks; he can be attacked personally without making the assault on press freedom and freedom of information too obvious. Political leaders and journalists outdo each other in condemning Assange and accusing him of espionage, treason and even terrorism. Extrapolating from the CableGate documents, it is not too difficult to imagine how, with each spectacular release, the US government increases the pressure on its allies to take Assange off the streets for good.

At the time, Assange is the guest of Vaughan Smith, staying at his country house, Ellingham Hall, near London. Smith, a former British Army captain, war reporter, founder of the Frontline Press Club in London and WikiLeaks sympathizer, considers Assange a kindred spirit on issues of freedom of expression and press freedom. Approximately one week after the release of the first series of diplomatic cables on 28 November 2010, Assange is informed that the EAW issued against him by the Swedish director of public prosecution has been formally certified by the British authorities. The following day, 7 December, Assange voluntarily reports to London’s Kentish Town police station. It is the British police that finally inform Assange of the Swedish allegations against him. Ever since Prosecutor Ny had reopened and expanded the preliminary investigation against Assange three months earlier, she had consistently refused to provide him with this most basic information – another piece in the puzzle. Had he known precisely what misconduct the prosecutor suspected him of, he could have stymied her strategy of procrastination by independently making a public statement responding to each point. But by publicly suspecting Assange of rape while never informing him of the details, the prosecutor deprived him of any effective possibility of defence, without herself having to present any evidence in support of her allegations. The strategy worked brilliantly – the longer the stalemate lasted, the deeper the official narrative of the ‘fugitive rapist’ took root and crystallized in the collective mind of the world public. As a result, eight years later, even I would initially decline to look into his case.

But on 7 December 2010, Assange voluntarily submits to arrest and is placed in solitary confinement in Wandsworth Prison for nine days, until he is released on bail and allowed to return to Ellingham Hall on 16 December. Numerous prominent supporters have vouched for him and raised the required bail of £200,000. For the next 550 days, as part of his bail conditions, Assange will have to live under house arrest, wear an electronic ankle bracelet and report to the police daily. Most importantly, in February 2011, he will face a hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court to discuss the Swedish extradition request.

#### Anglo-Swedish Collusion

In early January 2011, the Swedish Prosecution Authority shows the first signs of doubt. On 11 January, in preparation for the upcoming extradition hearing, Assange’s defence team presents its primary arguments and evidence and also names renowned Swedish experts as witnesses. This may have caused the Swedish authorities to pause for a moment and ponder how far they had already strayed from justice and the rule of law. At least temporarily, it almost seemed as if Prosecutor Ny had changed her mind and was now seriously entertaining the idea of interviewing Assange in London.

But then something remarkable happens. The British Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which represents Swedish interests in the extradition proceedings, advises against doing just that. ‘My earlier advice remains, that in my view it would not be prudent for the Swedish authorities to try to interview the defendant in the UK’, Paul Close writes on 25 January 2011 in an email to the Swedish Prosecution Authority. Note that he does not claim that interviewing Assange in London would not be ‘permissible’ or ‘possible’ but, rather, that it would not be ‘prudent’. He goes on to explain that ‘the defence would without any doubt seek to turn the event to its advantage. It would inevitably allege it was conclusive proof that the Swedish authorities had no case whatsoever against him and hence the interview was in the hope that he would make a full and frank confession.’ Furthermore, he adds, alluding to the Swedish practice of detaining rape suspects without bail: ‘General experience has also shown that attempts by foreign authorities to interview a defendant in the UK, frequently leads to the defence retort that that [*sic*] some inducements or threats were made by the interviewers (such as the prosecutors’ approach to bail on the defendant’s surrender to the foreign state). Thus I suggest you interview him only on his surrender to Sweden and in accordance with Swedish law.’

The British official goes on to provide guidance to the Swedes on how to gloss over the most problematic aspects of their entire investigation in the upcoming extradition hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court: ‘As we have discussed your prosecution is well based on the existing evidence and is sufficient to proceed to trial, which is the prosecution’s intention.’ The following – apparently important – paragraph is redacted, followed by the sentence, ‘You have the evidence of the complainants.’ The email closes with renewed assurances of support in analysing and responding to the defence arguments in court, and recommends a purely formal line, namely, ‘that Marianne Ny can issue a European Arrest Warrant and the Swedish authorities actually still do want to prosecute the defendant’. In other words, any substantive arguments or complaints about Swedish due process violations are not to be addressed, because these matters are not to be adjudicated by the courts in the United Kingdom, but by those in Sweden.

On the face of it, this is not a British case. Neither Assange nor the two women are British nationals, the alleged offences have not occurred in Britain, and the case is unlikely to result in an indictment, let alone a conviction, due to the lack of prosecutable evidence. So why is the CPS so keen to avoid a quick, uncomplicated and cost-effective resolution of this case through mutual legal assistance? Why needlessly lock Assange into a lengthy extradition proceeding that would generate a heavy workload and substantial expenses for the British government and judiciary? If there is one simple truism that has never failed me in my investigations of war crimes and human rights violations, it is that ‘where there is smoke, there is fire’. And where there is a lot of smoke, there must be a big fire. From now on, we will see that, whenever the British authorities deal with Assange, they make far more smoke than would be warranted by the issues supposedly at stake. As we advance through the following months, it will become increasingly difficult to escape the impression that the British authorities are pursuing a political agenda that goes far beyond the Swedish extradition request. This impression is confirmed verbatim in another email sent by Paul Close to Marianne Ny on 13 January 2011: ‘Please do not think that the case is being dealt with as just another extradition request.’

Over the next eighteen months, Assange’s extradition trial proceeds through all three instances in the British judicial system – Magistrates’ Court; High Court and Supreme Court. On 30 May 2012, the Supreme Court confirms the permissibility of the European Arrest Warrant issued by the Swedish prosecutor, thus green-lighting Assange’s extradition to Sweden. What sounds like a simple and straightforward matter warrants a closer look. To the layman, the following explanations on the EAW may seem technical and dull at first. But they will quickly illuminate the extent to which even the highest British court appears to be prepared to betray the rule of law for the sake of a desired political outcome.

So, here is the European Arrest Warrant in a nutshell. Between member states of the European Union (and the UK was still part of the EU in 2012), a valid, standardized EAW is sufficient to obtain an extradition. Whether there are sufficient evidentiary grounds to suspect, indict or convict a person of a crime does not need to be examined by the extraditing country. In contrast to extradition cases involving destination countries outside the EU, the entire procedure takes place on purely formal grounds. Questions of guilt or innocence, credibility and probative value are not raised in the extradition proceedings, but only during the subsequent criminal trial in the destination country. Therefore, none of these arguments can be raised effectively by Assange’s lawyers as a defence against extradition to Sweden.

From this formal perspective, only two conditions must be met to obtain an extradition within the EU: first, under the principle of dual criminality, the offences of which a person is suspected or charged must also be punishable in the country in which he is currently located. This requirement is met, because Assange is suspected of rape and sexual coercion in Sweden, both of which are criminal offences also in the United Kingdom. Second – and this is the primary bone of contention in Assange’s case – the EAW must have been issued by a competent authority. Both the EU Framework Decision of 2002 regulating the EAW system, and the British Extradition Act of 2003, which implement the EU Decision in the United Kingdom, require that an EAW be issued by a ‘judicial authority’. This requirement reflects the aim of the Framework Decision to depoliticize the extradition process throughout Europe by withdrawing it from the executive branch of government and placing it under the control of the respective judicial authorities.

This is the point of attack for Assange’s defence lawyers. In his case, the European Arrest Warrant has been issued by Marianne Ny – a prosecutor, not a judge. Hence, Assange’s lawyers argue, the warrant was not issued by a ‘judicial authority’ and therefore is not a valid basis for Assange’s extradition to Sweden. That also appears to be the British legal position. As the Supreme Court confirms, during the British parliamentary debates surrounding the adoption of the 2003 Extradition Act, it was repeatedly emphasized that the term ‘judicial authority’ necessarily implied a court or judge, not the police or a public prosecutor, and that this requirement would not be affected by the implementation of the EU Framework Decision. Sweden and a few other EU states have interpreted the term ‘judicial authority’ more broadly to include prosecutors. But this was not binding for the British judiciary, because, strictly speaking, it was not the wording of the overarching EU Framework Decision that the British judges had to interpret, but the British Extradition Act which had been adopted for the implementation of this decision. What was relevant for the Supreme Court was the interpretation given to the term ‘judicial authority’ by the British Parliament, and not by other EU states. Thus, in an email to Marianne Ny dated 8 February 2012, her British colleague from the Crown Prosecution Service writes with growing concern: ‘The court seems rather troubled by the whole question of other countries having such a wide interpretation of “judicial authority”, in particular how it can include prosecutors or officials from Ministries of Justice – I would stress again that it is UK law which [is] under the judicial spotlight not Swedish law.’

According to British legal tradition, Prosecutor Marianne Ny clearly is not a ‘judicial authority’. In order to still uphold her EAW and allow Assange’s extradition to Sweden, the Supreme Court must now engage in judicial acrobatics that can be better described as legal contortions. In Paragraph 93 of its ruling, the court acknowledges that the British Parliament’s explicitly narrow interpretation of the notion of ‘judicial authority’ is ‘certainly disturbing’, but then ventures to say that it would be going ‘at least one step too far, in constitutional terms, for this court to treat it as determinative’. The majority of the judges are guided by the hypothesis that, regardless of their express positions taken in the legislative debate, members of Parliament could not have intended to legislate contrary to the UK’s international obligations but, actually, preferred to interpret their own Extradition Act in conformity with the wording of the EU Framework Decision. The problem is, of course, that the meaning of the wording chosen in the EU Framework Decision only a year earlier was completely uncertain in 2003 when the UK Extradition Act came before the British Parliament – which is precisely why the clarifying parliamentary debate was necessary in the first place. But since then, we learn from the Supreme Court, an inconsistent practice has developed throughout the EU, with roughly one half of the member states restricting the term ‘judicial authority’ to adjudicating officials and bodies, which excludes prosecutors, whereas the other half interprets the same term more comprehensively and, in some cases, even extends it to prosecutors.

In view of these highly challenging circumstances, the judges find it imperative to ignore the parliamentary genesis of the directly applicable British Extradition Act and, instead, consider the administrative genesis of the EU Framework Decision, even though it is not directly applicable as a matter of law. The original first draft of this instrument having been written in French, the judges further conclude that priority must imperatively be given to the original French wording. The meaning of the French term ‘autorité judiciaire’, however, has not been defined, nor has it been clarified through uniform practice. Therefore, ‘autorité judiciaire’ can be interpreted either narrowly, as preferred by the British Parliament, or more broadly, as preferred by the government of Sweden.

For a variety of multi-layered and rather convoluted motives, five out of seven judges then happen to personally prefer the comprehensive interpretation of the French term ‘autorité judiciaire’, which also includes the public prosecutor. As a matter of logic, they argue, this expansive interpretation must therefore be regarded as binding also for the interpretation of the English term ‘judicial authority’ – not only in the English version of the EU Framework Decision, but also in the British Extradition Act, even though Parliament had expressly opted for the opposite interpretation. *Et voilà* – Prosecutor Ny’s European Arrest Warrant is valid, and Assange can be extradited to Sweden! You couldn’t make it up: the honourable Supreme Court of the United Kingdom bending over backwards in deference to political interests, and not hesitating to refer to the French text of an inapplicable EU Framework Decision in order to interpret the original English wording of directly applicable domestic legislation differently than Parliament – and then claiming that this is what Parliament presumably would have wanted in the first place.

Once their decision was in the bag, the judges nevertheless expressed their concern at the fact that the British Extradition Act – contrary to the explicit recommendation of the EU Council – does not require a proportionality test in order to ensure that a draconian coercive measure, such as extradition to another country, is justified in each individual case. In the Assange case, this question arose primarily because Sweden did not request the extradition of a person formally accused or convicted of a crime, but of a cooperative suspect in a preliminary investigation, who had already been voluntarily interviewed and who was ready and willing to respond to further questions, on the spot in London or by telephone or videoconference. Although the Supreme Court conveniently found that it could not examine the proportionality of Assange’s extradition in the absence of a corresponding legal provision in the Extradition Act, it made no secret of the fact that this was a formal shortcoming that needed to be addressed – a hint that was duly taken up by Parliament. Two years later, legislation came into force stipulating that, from now on, every single extradition would be subject to a proportionality test and that no person could be extradited before being formally charged with a crime. Both provisions would have prevented Assange’s extradition to Sweden and would have allowed him to leave his diplomatic asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy as a free man. But Parliament made sure to add a non-retroactivity clause that prevented the application of these new provisions to extradition cases that had already been decided, but not yet executed. There was exactly one man in the entire United Kingdom to whom this non-retroactivity clause applied. It was a ‘*lex Assange*’, as it has been poignantly termed, tailor-made by the British authorities for the persecution of a man who is constantly accused of evading justice – but who, quite on the contrary, is constantly deprived of justice precisely by those same authorities.

Assange’s lawyers avail themselves of one last legal remedy, requesting the Supreme Court to reopen the appeal, which is rejected on 14 June 2012. This means that Assange has now definitely exhausted the legal remedies available to him in the United Kingdom. The following day, Prosecutor Marianne Ny requests that the Supreme Court permit his immediate surrender to Sweden, thus effectively withdrawing the suspensive effect of a possible appeal by Assange to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The court declines and grants Assange a final reprieve of fourteen days. Nonetheless, his extradition to Sweden and – so he fears – his subsequent irregular surrender to the United States are now imminent.
