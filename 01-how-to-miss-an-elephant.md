### Chapter 1: How to Miss an Elephant

#### Out of Sight, Out of Mind!

It was just before Christmas 2018, and I was sitting at my desk working on my annual report for the Human Rights Council in Geneva. This is the UN body that had appointed me and to which I reported, as an independent expert, on the worldwide compliance with the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment. Twice a year I was expected to collectively address the UN member states: in the spring at the Human Rights Council in Geneva, and in the autumn at the General Assembly in New York. These were my opportunities to freely choose an issue relevant to the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment and to put it on the agenda of the world organization. The mandates of UN special rapporteurs are unpaid honorary positions. Like most colleagues, I earn my living as an academic: I am a professor of international law at the University of Glasgow and the Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights. The most powerful asset of UN special rapporteurs is their independence. Once elected, mandate holders are to be guided solely by their service to the cause of human rights and may not be influenced by anyone in the performance of their duties. In the exercise of their functions, they enjoy diplomatic immunity and operate largely outside the organization’s hierarchies, structures and decision-making processes, which are strongly dominated by political interests.

In an ideal world, with adequate budgets and sufficient staff, dedicated special rapporteurs could achieve a great deal. In the real world, however, states lack not only the financial means but also, and above all, the political will to effectively and comprehensively implement human rights, as this would require them to overcome outdated power structures, privileges and exploitation, which often are deeply intertwined with national politics. A proven means for states to limit the influence of special rapporteurs is the incessant creation of additional mandates and commissions on new human rights topics without increasing the overall budget available for the work of independent experts. In any case, the structural lack of financial and human resources for the special rapporteurs is hardly accidental.

In December 2018, I was busy finalizing my report, this time on the interrelation between corruption and torture (A/HRC/40/59), when suddenly a small window popped up on my screen, indicating the arrival of a new email. ‘Julian Assange is seeking your protection’, the subject line read. Julian Assange? Was this not the founder of WikiLeaks, the shady hacker with the white hair and the leather jacket who was hiding out in an embassy somewhere because of rape allegations? Out of nowhere, I was overtaken by a host of disparaging thoughts and almost reflexive feelings of rejection. Assange? No, I certainly would not be manipulated by this guy. After all, I had more important things to do: I had to take care of ‘real’ torture victims! I closed the pop-up window with a single click – out of sight, out of mind! Then I turned back to my report on overcoming prejudice and self-deception in connection with official corruption. Not until a few months later would I realize the striking irony of this situation.

#### What’s a UN Special Rapporteur?

Anyone can transmit allegations on violations of the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment to the special rapporteur on torture, or, as my full title reads, the ‘United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’. Requests for intervention can be submitted at any time, by standard letter or email, even before any violation has occurred and regardless of whether police reports, court proceedings or other formalities have been initiated.

All special rapporteurs are appointed directly by the forty-seven member states of the UN Human Rights Council in a lengthy selection process and carry out their functions with the strictest independence. We have no hierarchical superiors and may not seek or accept any instruction as to the exercise of our mandates, whether from the United Nations or from individual governments or other actors. My office is located in the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva, which is the organizational branch of the UN that deals with the protection of human rights. Two staff members are assigned to my mandate there, so-called Human Rights Officers. Every week, we receive about fifty requests for intervention and other enquiries. These can be initiated by torture victims themselves, but also by lawyers, NGO representatives, relatives, witnesses or even by other authorities, states or UN bodies. It is then up to my team to review the requests and, where necessary, obtain additional information in order to assess their credibility. Once consolidated, the case file is passed on to me for consideration and decision on the action to be taken.

Consistent with my mandate, my interventions are generally concerned with the prevention, investigation, prosecution, and redress of torture, corporal punishment and other cruel or degrading treatment, inhumane conditions of detention, and extraditions or deportations to states where people are at risk of being exposed to such abuse. The relevant violations may have been committed by state officials or at their instigation, or merely with their consent or acquiescence. In case of violations, I can intervene directly with the foreign ministers of all UN member states through the diplomatic missions in Geneva. This means that I transmit allegations I have received of torture and ill-treatment to the state concerned, that I request the government to clarify and comment on these allegations, and that I make recommendations on the measures to be taken. This correspondence and the government’s response initially remain confidential but, after sixty days, both are published on the High Commissioner’s website. In urgent cases, there is also the possibility of alerting the public through a press release. As special rapporteur, I do not exercise any judicial function, and my conclusions and recommendations are not binding on states.

Of the requests for intervention submitted to my office, we can address one in ten at best. A team of three simply cannot manage more, given that we also have to prepare official country visits, draft official reports and cooperate with other mechanisms for the protection of human rights, first and foremost with the other UN special rapporteurs, Working Groups and relevant committees. Every day we are therefore forced to set priorities and take difficult decisions without the luxury of lengthy reflection. When in doubt, we always prioritize urgent cases where it may still be possible to prevent imminent human rights violations. Depending on the workload, the requests received by my office result in between 100 and 200 official interventions per year. Of these, about a third do not even receive a response. While the remaining two-thirds of our interventions generally do receive responses, these are almost always inadequate in terms of the human rights protection sought. Thus, states often provide lengthy letters replete with diplomatic smooth-talk and assurances but, ultimately, fail to provide the requested information or to initiate the investigations and other measures required under international law. The bottom line is that in the vast majority of cases, documented abuse is neither acknowledged nor punished, corrected or compensated. Unfortunately, this does not apply only to states notorious for their human rights violations. When it comes to protecting their reputation or their economic and security policy interests, even mature democracies priding themselves on longstanding traditions in the rule of law suddenly start compromising on human rights.

As I demonstrated through a comprehensive statistical analysis in my annual report of 2021 (A/HRC/46/26), barely 10 per cent of my interventions receive the ‘full cooperation’ required by the Human Rights Council and are adequately resolved. It is a deplorable success rate, even if one disregards the countless additional requests that cannot even be acted upon due to the lack of resources. This trend has remained largely unchanged since the creation of my mandate in 1985 and seriously calls into question the credibility of the routinely celebrated commitment of all UN member states to the universal prohibition of torture. On individual allegations of torture, states hardly ever agree to engage in a serious dialogue that goes beyond diplomatic niceties, as this would require genuine changes of behaviour and uncomfortable decisions with which they are generally not prepared to follow through.

Due to our heavy caseload, I refer as many applicants as possible to other institutions and authorities that have greater resources and are better placed to follow individual cases in the long term. For example, it is certainly not the purpose of my mandate to replace the investigative authorities of functioning democracies, so long as the police, prosecutors and courts can actually be relied upon to accomplish their tasks in line with the rule of law. This question must always be weighed very carefully, because even in mature democracies things can go wrong – for example, when suspects are pressured to confess through ‘coercive detention’; when police brutality is not prosecuted and punished with sufficient determination; or when persons face extradition or deportation to a state where they would be exposed to a real risk of torture.

An entirely different assessment must be made for requests concerning states in which police and intelligence services are known to routinely kidnap and disappear people in broad daylight. In such cases, family members of the missing often cannot reasonably be expected to trust the local authorities. So I always have to conduct a careful evaluation and be on my guard. Finally, I must never allow my mandate to be misused for political or other extraneous purposes: beyond the loss of my own credibility, the mandate itself could be irreparably damaged.

#### Caught in My Own Prejudice

And now this request for help from Julian Assange’s lawyers? At some point during the next few hours, I brought myself to skim the full text of the message. Assange’s living conditions in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he had been staying since June 2012, were claimed to be incompatible with the prohibition of inhumane treatment and, therefore, to come within the scope of my mandate. I read this but was not convinced, or simply did not take it seriously. The possibility that Assange might truly be ill-treated did not even occur to me. Sure, I could imagine that he was no longer happy staying at the embassy and that he might be suffering a few health issues. Six years can be an eternity for someone confined to the same building. At the same time, I was still affected by all those headlines in the mainstream media which I had almost unconsciously absorbed over recent years: Assange, the cowardly rapist refusing to turn himself in to the Swedish authorities. Assange, the hacker and spy evading justice in the Ecuadorian embassy. Assange, the ruthless narcissist, traitor and bastard. And so forth.

Only later did I realize how much my perception had been distorted by prejudice. Years of exposure to scandalous headlines and biased reporting, though hardly perceived by my conscious mind, had formed an opinion deeply anchored in my emotions – an opinion which I was convinced was based on reliable facts. Thus, even after having read the email, I saw no reason to seriously consider the case of Julian Assange. ‘Manufacturing consent’ is the term introduced by Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky in the late 1980s to describe the communication model of the American mass media, one that has long since been globalized. They showed how self-censorship, anticipatory obedience and economic constraints lead many media institutions to smoothen their reporting in line with the generally accepted consensus. This is precisely what happened in the Assange case. The official narrative had the desired effect on public opinion – myself included.

The irony was striking. There I was, drafting my report on the links between corruption and torture, and failing to even notice that the intervention request submitted by Assange’s lawyers presented me with a prime example of my topic. In reality, the case of Julian Assange is primarily about political corruption, with judicial institutions and processes having been – and still being – abused for political purposes: for suppressing press freedom and freedom of information; for impunity over torture and war crimes; for the political persecution of dissidents, and for the secrecy of machinations incompatible with democracy and the rule of law.

I was not the only UN expert contacted by Assange’s lawyers in late 2018. They also wrote to the special rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD). On 21 December 2018, these colleagues issued a joint press release entitled ‘UN experts urge UK to honour rights obligations and let Mr. Julian Assange leave Ecuador embassy in London freely.’ I had been invited to join but declined. Instead, I shelved the letter from Assange’s lawyers without much thought and barely even noticed the press statement. To me, like to most people around the world, Assange was just a rapist, hacker, spy, and narcissist. Like so many, I was convinced that I knew the truth about him, even though I couldn’t quite remember where that knowledge had come from. It would be another three months before my opinion fundamentally changed.
