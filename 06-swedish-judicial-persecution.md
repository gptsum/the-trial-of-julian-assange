### Chapter 6: Swedish Judicial Persecution

#### Turning Point from Fame to Shame

By the summer of 2010, Assange is at the peak of his popularity. Everything seems to be going his way that year. In April, he presents the ‘Collateral Murder’ video at the Washington National Press Club, and at the end of July, the Afghan War Diary follows, with 90,000 field reports issued between 2004 and 2010. As the founder and face of WikiLeaks, Assange has become a veritable ‘rock star’. A man who dares to confront the powerful in politics and business and, at the same time, manages to overhaul the entire media landscape. In August 2010, he travels to Stockholm to give a lecture at the invitation of the Swedish Social Democrats.

He also intends to explore the possibility of obtaining a residence permit for himself, which would allow him to establish WikiLeaks as an officially recognized Swedish publisher. The resulting status of a legally protected press organization could give WikiLeaks formal legitimacy and virtually unassailable protection under the Swedish constitution. This would provide the organization with one of the world’s strongest safe havens for publishing activities – a definite game changer, of decisive importance for the huge releases planned for the autumn and winter 2010/2011 and beyond.

At the same time, much is at stake for Sweden’s political establishment. A small country of 8 million inhabitants, Sweden has in the past century managed to stay out of two world wars and the Cold War. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, however, the country rapidly gave up its traditional neutrality and became a de facto member of the Western security, intelligence and defence community led by the United States. Come 2010, Sweden is now a close ally of the United States in Afghanistan and the broader ‘War on Terror’, with a security policy that can only be described as subservient to US interests. This development does not sit too well with most of the Swedish population, so that politicians constantly have to go out of their way to sweep it under the carpet. On 10 August, the US news website ‘The Daily Beast’ reports US officials as saying that the Obama administration is pressing Britain, Germany, Australia, and other allied Western governments to consider opening criminal investigations against Assange and to severely limit his ability to travel across international borders. Without any doubt, having WikiLeaks established in Sweden as a constitutionally protected publisher would put the Swedish government’s transatlantic relations under considerable strain, and constitutional protections combined with public sympathy for the organization would make any interference with its activities exceedingly difficult.

This is the background to Julian Assange’s visit to Sweden in August and September 2010, which will become the most dramatic turning point in the public perception of him as a person. It is no exaggeration to say that, on the day Sweden issues an arrest warrant against Assange for the alleged rape and harassment of two women, his fame turns to shame and his success story into a story of persecution. Even more importantly for an accurate understanding of the Swedish dimension of the case, however, these allegations cause vital Swedish supporters for the institutional establishment of WikiLeaks in Sweden to hesitate or pull back; Assange’s Swedish residence permit is refused; and the Swedish government’s worst nightmare is averted in the nick of time.

Significantly, as a matter of legal procedure, the Swedish allegations never managed to evolve beyond the initial stage of a preliminary investigation, where they were left to simmer for nine years before finally being dismissed for lack of evidence. Nevertheless, they set in motion a dynamic of vilification and arbitrariness that continues to this day. As will be demonstrated in this book, it was the refusal of the Swedish authorities to guarantee against Assange’s onward extradition to the United States, and not the allegations of sexual misconduct, that led him to resist extradition to Sweden and request diplomatic asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in June 2012. Assange’s escape to the embassy, in turn, violated British bail conditions in connection with the Swedish extradition proceedings. For this bail violation, committed only to seek protection from serious violations of his human rights, Assange was sentenced to fifty weeks in prison seven years later – the only ‘offence’ he has been convicted of so far. Finally, while serving that sentence, the proceedings began for Assange’s extradition to the United States, where he faces a political trial and almost certainly a life sentence without parole.

The rape allegations initiated by the Swedish authorities became the starting point of a sustained and concerted campaign of judicial persecution and public mobbing that would systematically corner and dehumanize Assange. The resulting prejudice had caused even me – a mandated human rights expert of the United Nations – to carelessly swipe off my screen Assange’s initial appeal for help. It was only in November 2019, after nine years of extreme procrastination and arbitrariness, that the Swedish Prosecution Authority finally admitted to the lack of evidence and dismissed all remaining allegations. Nine months later, in August 2020, the final statute of limitations came into effect, thus drawing a line under what must have been the longest ‘preliminary investigation’ in Swedish history. Throughout the entire proceedings, Sweden never came up with sufficient evidence to press charges against Assange, let alone to convict him of any offence. Throughout the entire proceedings, Assange should have been presumed innocent as a matter of law, and he certainly must be considered innocent now. In stark contradiction to this requirement, the aggressive bias and arbitrariness with which the Swedish authorities pursued these allegations, and the carefully ambiguous rhetoric they maintained, even when they finally closed their investigation in 2019, ensured that the ‘rapist’ stigma would remain forever branded on Assange’s forehead and prevent his case from being seen for what it is: a story of political persecution.

#### My Investigation of the Rape Allegations

My investigation of the Swedish rape allegations is a particularly sensitive dimension of this case, because it concerns not only Julian Assange and the responsible state authorities, but also affects the personal privacy and human dignity of A. and S., the two women involved. In examining these allegations, I therefore had to adhere to particularly high standards of responsibility and care towards all parties. In principle, I consider all three individuals – Assange, A. and S. – to be equally credible. As we know from numerous scientific studies comparing witness accounts, depending on the circumstances, different people can perceive the same events very differently. In my view, to the extent relevant for determining criminal culpability, the discrepancies between the respective accounts given by Assange, A. and S. are by no means unusual or suspicious but fall within the normal range of varying perceptions that could be expected to arise in intimate encounters between strangers. Particularly in the presence of very strong influencing factors such as the clash of the women’s admiration for Assange with the potentially impaired interpersonal sensitivity caused by his diagnosed autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but also the distorting effects of powerful third-party interests and involuntary media exposure.

The comprehensive criminalization and systematic prosecution of sexual offences of all kinds is of great importance and does not allow for any compromise, regardless of the identity, status, or origin of the suspect and without regard to his or her political, professional, humanitarian, or other achievements or merits. Every allegation of rape and other sexual offence must be rigorously investigated, and every prosecutable case vigorously pursued, to a far greater extent than occurs now. Even in modern democracies, the prosecution rate for reported rapes is often unacceptably low, which speaks volumes about the level of priority given to such crimes by the responsible authorities. As will be shown, contrary to public perception, the Swedish authorities did everything to prevent a proper investigation and judicial resolution of their rape allegations against Assange. In so acting, they demonstrated a shocking indifference to the rights and dignity not only of Assange, but also of the two women involved. Moreover, justice requires the professional and reliable determination of individual culpability in accordance with the fundamental principles of due process, including the right to a fair and expeditious trial, the presumption of innocence, and the principle of *in dubio pro reo* according to which the accused receives the benefit of the doubt. Throughout the Swedish investigation against Assange, none of these principles was even remotely respected.

As special rapporteur, I am mandated to monitor the compliance of UN Member States with the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment. Clearly, therefore, the aim of my investigation cannot be to determine what actually happened between Assange and the two Swedish women, to speculate about individual guilt or innocence, or to express my opinion on the character traits or moral conduct of private individuals. That said, reconstructing relevant acts and omissions by key protagonists in this case may still be necessary for the purposes of my mandate, because the handling of these facts by the authorities allows me to draw conclusions as to their good faith and compliance with due process principles.

For example, when contradictory or exculpatory evidence inconsistent with the official narrative is deliberately disregarded or even suppressed by the authorities, this may not prove Assange’s innocence, but it is certainly a strong indicator for an arbitrary and corrupted proceeding. Official arbitrariness almost always constitutes a central element in political persecution and related ill-treatment and therefore clearly falls within the scope of my mandate. All evidence cited in this book, as well as my conclusions, must be understood and evaluated exclusively in this light. Materials of a purely personal nature, irrelevant to the outcome of my investigation or where personal privacy is paramount, have not been included in this book, even if they are not disputed and are publicly available through other channels.

Since I began working on the Assange case, I have collected some 10,000 pages of court files, witness statements, trial assessments and analyses, emails, SMS transcripts and handwritten notes, as well as photographs and video. Despite my requests, the authorities did not provide any reliable evidence or explanations. Thus, even official documents, which constitute the bulk of the evidence and should have been made available to me by the authorities themselves, had to be painstakingly compiled through other sources. The most commonly accessible pieces of evidence I obtained through my own research, whereas others were passed to me by numerous independent sources and through a variety of channels. Also, most key documents were received from several sources in parallel, often of varying quality and completeness. My knowledge of the Swedish language was of great advantage in the process.

Although the four governments made sure to classify, suppress and even destroy almost all the most decisive evidence, they did not completely succeed in keeping the lid on their collusion and misconduct. First, anyone who knows what to look for and has the necessary language skills will be able to find the most important pieces of evidence somewhere in the bottomless memory of the internet, and very extensive materials have also been made publicly available by WikiLeaks and its supporter groups. Second, through freedom of information requests and related litigation, investigative journalists and human rights activists have forced the authorities to hand over thousands of pages that are not – or not in full – available on the internet. In most cases, however, these materials have been excessively censored, thus all but defeating the very purpose of any freedom of information legislation. It would have been more honest to flatly decline a freedom of information request involving official correspondence, witness hearings, expert opinions or internal memos, than to hand over a pile of blacked-out papers showing nothing but the document title, the date and the page numbers – and to claim with a straight face that this obvious mockery amounts to anything remotely similar to ‘freedom of information’.

Given that, under current legislations, freedom of information requests can be refused only in exceptional circumstances, public authorities usually prefer to hand over hundreds of completely redacted documents, along with an invoice based on the total number of pages, and to assert that any redactions have been strictly limited to what is required by law – a claim that remains as unverifiable as it is unconvincing in the face of a heap of black paper. Even in mature democracies such as Sweden, the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States, this widespread, clearly abusive practice is employed to prevent the transparency and oversight pursued by applicable freedom of information legislation, thus effectively suppressing the public’s right to know the truth about the exercise of governmental power.

This means that in investigating the case of Julian Assange I found myself confronted with countless pieces of a puzzle, some of which I had received in multiple copies while others are still missing. Even now, therefore, I have no way of knowing with certainty how many pieces the whole puzzle actually comprises. The reason for this continued uncertainty is that the involved states not only refuse to ‘fully cooperate’ with my mandate as required by the relevant UN resolutions, but also openly violate their international obligations under the Convention against Torture and other applicable human rights treaties. States are not only called to respond to all queries transmitted by a UN special rapporteur, but they are also legally obliged to conduct a prompt and impartial investigation whenever they have reasonable grounds to believe that torture or ill-treatment have occurred within their jurisdiction, to prosecute violations, and to provide redress and rehabilitation for the resulting harm. With their blatant sabotage of my investigation, these states deliberately undermine the purpose of my UN mandate and, at the same time, demonstrate the lack of credibility of their own human rights policies.

As a result, my reconstruction of the facts relevant to the case of Julian Assange may still have a couple of blank spots, and, on specific issues, may allow for other interpretations of the acts and omissions attributable to the involved States, their authorities and individual officials. Whichever way they are assembled, however, the available puzzle pieces always yield the same conclusive picture, namely that the trial of Assange is not about the rule of law, but about political persecution, and that investigative and judicial institutions are being deliberately abused for that purpose. Victimized by this abuse are not only Assange but also the two Swedish women. From the very beginning, their legitimate interests were systematically disregarded by the authorities and they were ruthlessly exposed and instrumentalized for the purposes of a political persecution. The upshot has been that their public lives have been largely destroyed; they were made to fear for their own safety, have been vilified as secret agents, honeytraps and liars, and have received no redress for the harm so wantonly inflicted on them by the authorities – two sacrificial victims of Swedish *raison d’état*.

#### The Case of A.

Assange arrives in Stockholm on 11 August 2010. As usual, to reduce the risk of surveillance, he will not be staying at a hotel, but with private hosts. This time it is A., a political activist involved in organizing his seminar, who has offered to accommodate him in her studio in the Södermalm district of Stockholm. A. herself plans to spend a few days outside the city and to return only on 14 August, the day of Assange’s lecture. Before leaving, she hands the keys to journalist Donald Boström, who welcomes Assange and takes him to A.’s apartment. But A. returns one day earlier than expected, on Friday, 13 August, and meets Assange in her studio. The two go out for dinner and then return to her apartment, where A. invites Assange to spend the night with her.

During her interview with the police one week later, A. will recount her version of events. According to the written summary filed by the police, A. stated that Assange had tried to initiate sex; that his attempts were rather clumsy at first but then grew increasingly demanding; that she eventually allowed him to undress her but did not want to have unprotected intercourse; that Assange initially held her arms and pushed her legs down, which prevented her from reaching for a condom. Eventually, he asked her why she was resisting and, when she explained, agreed to use a condom. Nonetheless, A. sensed a ‘strong unspoken reluctance by Assange to use a condom, and immediately became suspicious when, during intercourse, he ‘withdraws from her and begins to adjust the condom. Judging from the sound, according to [A.], it seemed that Assange removed the condom. He entered her again and continued the copulation.’ But when she reached down, she was reassured to feel the lower edge of the condom with her fingers. She therefore allowed intercourse to continue until Assange ejaculated inside her. Afterwards, when Assange withdrew and removed the condom, A. saw that it did not contain any semen and she noticed that something ‘ran’ out of her body. A. then became ‘convinced that when he withdrew from her the first time, Assange deliberately broke the condom at its tip and then continued copulating to ejaculation’. Assange himself confirmed during his police interview a few days later that he had had consensual intercourse with A., but denied damaging the condom. He also said that he had no recollection of the condom having been damaged and that A. had not made any comment to that effect, but that she first made this allegation one week later, on the same day she visited the police station together with S.

The morning after this first night at A.’s apartment, Assange gives his lecture ‘The First Casualty of War Is the Truth’, concerning the Afghan War Diary, which had just been published by WikiLeaks. A. sits next to him on the podium and serves as his press secretary during the subsequent discussion. In the front row of the audience sits S., a young woman often described as wearing a bright pink cashmere sweater. She works in a museum in the city, is a big Assange fan and has been eagerly anticipating the event. According to several witnesses and her own testimony, everyone wonders where this woman comes from, whom no one knows and whose appearance and manner do not quite fit in with the rest of the audience. When Assange needs a charging cable for his laptop during the seminar, she offers to get one from an electronics store, and hands it to him personally. After the seminar, she joins the large group gathered for lunch and comes to Assange’s attention. They later spend the afternoon together and end up at the cinema, where they touch each other intimately.

In the evening, A. honours Assange with a traditional Swedish crayfish party in her garden. A friend of A.’s later testifies that, during the party, A. told her that she had had intercourse with Assange and the condom had broken, albeit without accusing him of bad intentions. In the middle of the night, with the party still going on, A. posts an enthusiastic tweet: ‘Sitting outside at 2 am and barely freezing with the coolest, smartest people in the world, it’s just amazing!’ Donald Boström, who was also at the party, said that A. told him a few days later that she was ‘proud as a peacock – the world’s most awesome man in my bed and living in my flat’. The night of the crayfish party they again share A.’s bed, although several acquaintances have already offered to host Assange in view of the cramped conditions in A.’s apartment. According to witnesses, A. declined these offers saying that Assange was welcome to continue staying with her. Johannes Wahlström, one of Assange’s primary contacts in Sweden, testified that he checked with A. every day whether Assange should be accommodated elsewhere. According to Wahlström, A. had complained jokingly about her ‘adoptive child’s’ nightly laptop sessions in the bathroom and his careless hygiene, but always confirmed that everything was fine, and that Assange could continue to stay with her.

#### The Case of S.

On the following Monday, 16 August, Assange receives a call from S., with whom he had spent the afternoon two days earlier. They meet late in the evening and decide to take the train to Enköping near Stockholm, where S. lives. The next morning at 9:40 a.m., A. receives a message on her cell phone: Johannes Wahlström asks her to please remind Assange of a meeting at the journalists’ union which is scheduled for noon that day. During his subsequent questioning by the police, Wahlström will read out the SMS correspondence directly from his cell phone to the interviewing officer. A. texts in reply, ‘He is not here. He has been planning every night to have sex with the cashmere girl but has not been able to find the time. Perhaps he managed to do so yesterday?’ A. does not have S.’s phone number but gives Wahlström her email address instead and says that S. works at the Museum of Natural History – ‘That’s all I know.’ This correspondence suggests that, in his conversations with A., Assange had made no secret of his intention to seek a sexual fling with S. It also suggests that A. was not particularly worried about that prospect.

It is midnight when Assange and S. arrive at her apartment. According to S.’s testimony and her irritated text messages to two friends between 1:14 and 1:43 a.m., Assange first wants unprotected sex, which S. refuses, and then falls asleep after long foreplay. S. is disappointed and complains that he ‘generally behaves weirdly’, but eventually falls asleep as well. Sexual intercourse occurs only later during the night, sometime before her next text message at 5:15 a.m. When S. insists on the use of a condom, Assange accepts, albeit rather reluctantly, according to S.’s account. On the morning of 17 August, between 7:22 and 7:46 a.m., another text message chat takes place in which S. expresses her annoyance at Assange’s snoring next to her. Within the following hour, S. leaves the apartment to buy breakfast, then serves Assange oatmeal porridge, milk, and juice and returns to bed with him, where they again have protected sex. In an SMS chat between 8:42 and 8:59 a.m., S. writes, clearly put out, that Assange had been reluctant to use a condom, that he even ‘ordered’ her to serve him orange juice, and that he was snoring again. Her next message follows exactly ninety minutes later, at 10:29. It is during these ninety minutes that the alleged rape is said to have occurred.

According to the written summary prepared by the police of S.’s interview, after their – protected – sexual intercourse earlier that morning, both Assange and S. had ‘dozed off’. After some time, Assange allegedly tried to penetrate S. again, but this time without a condom. The police summary states that ‘she awoke and felt him penetrating her’. Immediately, she asked him, ‘Are you wearing anything?’ to which he replied, ‘You.’ She said: ‘You better don’t have HIV’, and he replied, ‘Of course not.’ The summary continues: ‘She felt that it was too late. He was already inside her and she let him continue [*lät honom fortsätta*]. She didn’t have the energy to tell him one more time. She had gone on and on about condoms [*tjatat om kondom*] all night long. She has never had unprotected sex before. He said he wanted to come inside her; he did not say when he did, but he did it. A lot ran out of her afterward.’

It should be noted that, under the domestic legislation and case law applicable in Sweden in 2010, mere physical contact between the sexual organs of two persons is already considered sexual intercourse, regardless of penetration; that being asleep is considered a state of helplessness; and that deliberately exploiting such a state of helplessness to initiate sexual intercourse amounts to the crime of rape and cannot be excused by the victim’s subsequent consent. Any form of rape, in turn, must always be prosecuted ex officio, regardless of the victim’s agreement with such prosecution, and carries a penalty of at least two years in prison. The broader definition of ‘rape’ which is in force today, and includes any sexual intercourse without the full consent of the involved parties, was not introduced in Sweden until the 2018 revision of the Criminal Code. The same applies to the newly introduced offence of ‘negligent rape’, so that, in 2010, the crime of rape in Sweden still requires proof of the perpetrator’s culpable intent.

S.’s nocturnal text messages in which she repeatedly expresses irritation about Assange’s desire to have sex without a condom make it clear that he could not in good faith assume her consent to unprotected intercourse. However, the conversation between Assange and S. reproduced in the police summary of her interview, which ends with her ‘letting him continue’ without a condom, offers no indication of violence, threats, or any exercise of power that could have precluded S.’s freedom of action or decision. Assange’s criminal liability under the Swedish law in force at the time therefore hinges exclusively on whether S. had been asleep and, if so, whether he was aware of her helpless state at the moment of the unprotected penetration.

The only piece of evidence which can be considered to provide reasonably reliable indications as to how S. genuinely experienced this incident is a text message sent by her to a friend almost twenty-four hours later, on 18 August at 6:59 a.m., stating that she had been ‘half asleep’ when Assange had unprotected intercourse with her. This choice of words leaves room for reasonable doubt, as it excludes neither that S. was in a helpless state due to sleep nor that she was sufficiently aware of Assange’s attempted penetration that her freedom of action and decision was not completely suspended.

Assange himself later asserted that S. had not been asleep and had consented to unprotected intercourse before it began. Just as in the case of A., particularly coming from a suspect diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, his own perception of events may be genuine without necessarily constituting reliable evidence for how the situation was experienced by S. But absent a confession, he must be considered innocent until proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Just like any other suspect.

S.’s account of the events, in turn, was not transcribed verbatim, nor was it recorded by audio device or witnessed by a second police officer, but merely summarized in the words of the interviewing officer. Moreover, as will be shown, the police summary of S.’s statement was only read back to her and approved by her almost two weeks later, on 2 September 2010. By then, the Swedish authorities had already amended the text without S.’s participation, had seized complete control of the narrative, and had created an almost incontestable fait accompli by aggressively disseminating the rape allegations through the mass media. Within the past two weeks, her case had been opened by one prosecutor on probable cause of rape, discontinued by another for lack of evidence and then reopened by a third, who officially reaffirmed that Assange was indeed suspected on probable cause of rape. Thus, by the time S. was first asked to approve the written summary of her own interview, she was already under massive pressure to conform to the official rape narrative imposed by the authorities, on pain of exposing herself to blame for falsely accusing Assange. Therefore, on the question of whether S. had been asleep at the relevant moment and, if so, whether Assange had been aware of her helpless state, her police interview cannot be considered as reliable evidence either.

All in all, on the only points of fact that were decisive for Assange’s criminal liability, there had clearly been reasonable doubt from the start. Objectively, in the absence of a relevant criminal record or a confession on the part of Assange, there was never any realistic prospect of successfully prosecuting him for the rape of S. Whatever may have happened between Assange and S. during those ninety minutes on the morning of 17 August 2010, from an evidentiary perspective, the only conceivable outcome of indicting Assange for the rape of S. would necessarily have been acquittal, based on the benefit of the doubt. Any other outcome would have defeated the presumption of innocence and the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt, two universal bedrock principles of criminal law.

The Swedish investigating authorities must have been fully aware of their evidentiary impasse. Assessing the objective likelihood of a conviction is an integral part of any professional criminal investigation: it serves to prevent both the pointless squandering of public resources and unnecessary reputational harm and trauma to suspects and others involved. As soon as it becomes clear that, irrespective of the investigative measures undertaken, there is no realistic prospect of proving an alleged offence beyond reasonable doubt, the case must be discontinued, regardless of the personal preferences of the officials involved. Accordingly, Chapter 23 Section 1 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure states: ‘A preliminary investigation need not be initiated if it is manifest that it is not possible to investigate the offence.’ The fact that the Swedish authorities continued to disseminate and perpetuate the rape narrative against Assange for more than nine years, when the lack of prosecutable evidence should have been immediately apparent to any experienced prosecutor, strongly suggests that other motives were in play.

#### Two Women Insist on an HIV Test

Neither S. nor Assange have claimed that their unprotected intercourse triggered an argument or other disagreement. Rather, they joke about the consequences of a possible pregnancy: S. warns that Assange would have to pay for her tuition fees, and he suggests that the child should be named ‘Afghanistan’. But after they part ways, S.’s amusement wanes. She begins to feel mounting anxiety. Not only is she worried about an unwanted pregnancy, but also about a potential infection with a sexually transmitted disease (STD), most notably HIV. Her text messages show how her fear grows and her helplessness turns to anger. ‘I feel totally used’, she writes, and then, ‘I want revenge. But how?’; ‘I hope the USA gets him’ and ‘I wish I dared to make money out of this’. And, again and again, an overwhelming fear of having contracted HIV. Still on Tuesday, 17 August, S. decides to get a prescription for the morning-after pill, and on the next day she visits a clinic for advice. Swedish hospitals offer alleged victims of sexual offences immediate and free testing for STDs. During the night from Wednesday to Thursday, her text messages become increasingly distraught: should she undergo a four-week preventive HIV antiviral therapy? She wants her test results – now!

When S. wakes up on Friday morning, 20 August, she knows: the only quick way to get clarity on a possible HIV infection is for Assange himself to get tested. If he had been infected more than three months ago, it would already show in his blood. So, if Assange tested negative now, the probability of her having contracted HIV from him would be close to zero. She sends an email to A. asking how she can get in touch with him.

That morning, S. travels to Stockholm’s main hospital, Södersjukhuset, to receive strong medication as HIV post-exposure prophylaxis. The counsellor at the clinic contacts the police, and an officer speaks with S. by phone. When she tells her story, the officer explains that what she has experienced is not rape, apparently based on the – clearly inaccurate – assumption that the crime of rape requires some physical resistance on the part of the victim. But S. does not appear to be concerned with criminal law – what upsets her is that the result of her HIV test will not be available for another three months.

Then, at 11:16 a.m., A. finally sends an SMS responding to S.’s earlier email: ‘Hi, here is my mobile number. [A.].’ And so the two women, whose contact thus far had been merely superficial, start talking, initially by phone. They speak about their respective experiences with Assange and want to convince him to get tested for HIV. In her police interview of 2 September 2010, S. asserts that it had been A.’s idea to involve the police. According to S., A. had suggested they go to the station together and file a criminal complaint. However, they would not sign the complaint, but only use it as leverage against Assange. If he then agreed to get tested, they would simply withdraw the complaint. According to S., at the time of this phone conversation, Assange is still with A. in her small apartment, but he does not understand Swedish. Shortly thereafter, S. receives an angry call from Assange. He says that A. has asked him to call S. and told him that she, S., intends to go to the police because of the HIV test. S. begs him to just do the test, explaining that it would take him a mere thirty minutes to relieve her from a three-month wait for her own results. But Assange allegedly replies that he has to take care of Guantánamo, of human lives, and therefore has absolutely no time for such trivialities. A veritable telephonic battle ensues between all involved parties, with Donald Boström trying to mediate and get Assange to take the women’s concerns seriously. When Assange finally agrees to take the test, but wants to meet S. first; it is already too late. S. no longer believes he is serious and decides to involve the police to make sure he gets tested. With that in mind, S. steps onto the escalator leading up to Klara police station, at Stockholm’s main train station.

#### The Police Impose a Rape Narrative

According to S., she first enters the police station around 2 p.m. At the reception, she briefly explains her concerns and then agrees to return together with A. at 4 p.m. for a meeting with a police officer experienced in the field of sexual offences. A. is still at work and cannot join earlier. Although the initial police memorandum indicates that both women arrived at the police station ‘around 2 p.m.’ (*vid 14 tiden*), during her police interview of 2 September 2010, S. is clear that their meeting with the police did not begin until 4 p.m. – time enough for the police to give the matter some thought. Strikingly, when S. first enters the police station at 2 p.m., the officer present at the reception appears to be keen to register a criminal complaint against Assange. Only twenty-six minutes later, at 2:26 p.m., while S. is still waiting for A. to arrive at the police station, she sends the following text message to a friend: ‘I am with the police. The “sosse” [slang for social democrat, meaning A.] and I are pressing Julian via his assistant to go and get tested. The police officer appears to like the idea of getting him [*att få tag på honom*].’ While I have found no direct evidence that the police were notified in advance of S.’s visit to the station, it seems to be extremely unusual, to say the least, for a law enforcement officer to demonstrate such individualized prejudice spontaneously.

S. herself has consistently emphasized, both during her police interviews and in her text messages, that she had no intention to report a crime, but visited the police station only to seek advice on how to obtain an HIV-test from Assange. She had inquired by phone about a police service specialized in such matters but was told that such a service did not exist. According to S., after her visit to the clinic at Södersjukhuset, she therefore simply went to the nearest police station. Klara police station does seem like a natural choice for S., being located in the central train station serving Enköping, her place of residence. However, Klara police station is also where Inspector Irmeli Krans is on duty at the time, a Facebook friend of A.’s with whom she has been in personal contact since at least 2009 – mere coincidence, according to A.

Be that as it may, at least the initial conversation with S. and A. is conducted by a different police officer, Inspector Linda Wassgren. S. recounts her version of the events. When A., sitting next to her, hears S.’s story, she immediately intervenes and asserts a similar experience of her own. She now tells her own story about unprotected sexual intercourse with Assange, claiming that he deliberately ripped his condom. Thus, no more than a few minutes into the conversation, the issue is no longer about pressuring Assange to take an HIV test, but takes a different turn, at least in the perception of the police. According to S., Wassgren very quickly comes to the conclusion that what has happened constitutes rape and that she, Wassgren, is therefore obliged to file a criminal report, regardless of their consent. Revealingly, Wassgren’s internal memo summarizing her conversation with A. and S. focuses exclusively on justifying the opening of an investigation for rape. The women’s original query regarding the possibility of forcing Assange to take an HIV test is not mentioned anywhere, and, for Inspector Wassgren, does not appear to have any relevance whatsoever. The women are confused, anxious, and reluctant to go along with a criminal report, but Wassgren makes it clear that they have no say in the matter. At the same time, she also reassures them that there will be no inconveniences and that nothing will be made public unless and until Assange is formally charged and tried in court. Wassgren’s memo does not reflect the women’s reluctance and legitimate concerns but immediately rewrites history. In particular, Wassgren notes that, ‘from the beginning’ (*inledelsevis*), the crime of rape was mentioned and that both women had been victims, which is inconsistent with the women’s version of events. Therefore she, Wassgren, ‘obviously’ decided to talk to the women separately and ask each one for a ‘detailed description’ of their experiences.

While the decision to speak to the women separately is correct, of course, this should have been done from the outset. The reliability of mutually influencing witness statements has a notoriously short half-life, especially in politically exposed cases that are influenced by strong third-party interests. By the time Wassgren decides to separate the two women, they have not only discussed their respective experiences privately and come up with a joint plan on how to address their shared concerns. They have also listened to each other at the police station and have seen the initial reactions of the police officer, the suggestive effect of which can hardly be overestimated in view of their own sense of insecurity. They know, of course, that they are dealing with a celebrity. They are angry, confused and vulnerable, and they have also very quickly understood what the police wants them to say. From their point of view, it is still all about the HIV test. But the Swedish police has a different agenda.

What follows looks like a hastily prepared choreography being played out according to the script, but much too rushed to resemble a natural unfolding of events. Contrary to what her memo seems to suggest, Inspector Wassgren does not, in fact, bother to conduct detailed interviews with either woman but acts immediately. Already at 4:11 p.m., a first criminal report for rape is registered in the system, containing the – demonstrably untrue – assertion that S. herself has reported Assange for rape. Conversely, S.’s real concern – the HIV test – is not even mentioned in the report. Here too, S.’s declared needs and primary concerns appear to be perceived as completely irrelevant. All that seems to matter to the Swedish police is getting a rape allegation against Assange registered as quickly as possible. Perhaps too quickly. The electronic timestamp on the criminal report, 4:11, raises serious questions not only because it is registered only eleven minutes after the beginning of the initial meeting between Inspector Wassgren and the two women, but also because it is not recorded in the name of Wassgren but in that of Inspector Irmeli Krans, who conducts the full interview with S. after Wassgren’s initial conversation with the two women. While it is highly unlikely that Wassgren could – or would – have electronically registered a criminal report in her colleague’s name, Krans’s interview with S. undisputedly does not begin until ten minutes later, at 4:21, and lasts until 6:40. Needless to say, in any natural sequence of events, a criminal report by Inspector Krans would be filed at the end of her interview with S. and certainly not before it has even started. Unless, of course, the decision to report Assange for rape has been taken already in advance and Krans merely played out a plot predetermined by authorities who ‘appeared to like the idea of getting him’. The electronic timestamp on the criminal report for the rape of S. certainly is yet another indicator that, from the perspective of the authorities, her visit to Klara police station may have been less spontaneous and coincidental than it has been portrayed.

A second criminal report is recorded at 4:31 p.m., this time in the name of Wassgren, again containing the – demonstrably untrue – assertion that A. had come to the police station with the intention of reporting Assange for sexual harassment. After her initial conversation with Wassgren, A. returns to work without a protocolled interview being conducted. With two registered criminal reports against Assange for sexual offences, the police seem to have obtained all that matters to them. Collecting reliable evidence in support of these allegations appears to be perceived as a formality that can be taken care of at a later stage.

To sum up, in both cases, criminal reports were registered by the police before the women had been formally interviewed, and in the case of S. before the reporting police officer had even spoken to her. In both cases, it was falsely asserted that the women themselves had intended to report a sexual offence against Assange, although this demonstrably had not been their intention. As if to cover her back, Wassgren detailed in her memo that she had consulted with various departments and that ‘everyone’ had been ‘unanimous’ that this was rape.

Both women later confirmed that Wassgren had immediately made very clear to them that the alleged facts amounted to the crime of rape and must be prosecuted ex officio, regardless of their own preferences or consent. By confronting the women with their own juridical powerlessness and the inescapability of the official rape narrative, the Swedish authorities swiftly hijacked the women’s personal stories and experiences for their own purposes. It seems that they wanted to create a fait accompli as quickly as possible and without the women’s interference. A. had just left the police station, and S. was still relating her version of events to Inspector Krans, when Inspector Wassgren picked up the phone and informed the public prosecutor on duty, Maria Häljebo Kjellstrand, of the two newly registered criminal reports. The prosecutor, too, struck immediately and, at 5:00 p.m., issued an arrest warrant against Assange on probable cause of rape. No written report or witness statements required, no need for clarification, no questions asked. Once the deed was done, Wassgren entered Krans’s office, where S. was still being interviewed, and announced that an arrest warrant had been issued against Assange.

Let this sink in for a moment. A public prosecutor issues an arrest warrant on probable cause of rape against a politically controversial public figure, solely on the basis of a phone call from a police inspector who has spoken to two women, neither of whom intended to report a crime, but whose real request was not even taken note of? Without any recorded interview with the women, with no other evidence, and no attempt to obtain a statement from the suspect? A suspect who poses no danger whatsoever, who is not violent and who does not threaten anyone? Why so much haste? Because Assange is not a Swedish citizen, because he is a flight risk, and because he must be prevented from interfering with the investigation, the Prosecution Authority explains in a press release on the following Monday, 23 August. But then, if this was the case, why was Assange not arrested? Why was he left to find out from the press about the allegations against him? All we know for sure is that when he did find out, Assange did not try to escape, but voluntarily postponed his departure from Sweden, which had originally been planned for 25 August, by a full month and made himself available for questioning by the police and the Prosecution Authority.

When S. receives the news about the arrest warrant, she seems to be caught completely off guard. At 5:06 p.m., still sitting in Inspector Krans’s office, she sends a text message to A. to inform her of the news. She is ‘shocked’ that they wanted to arrest Assange, S. writes, when all she wanted from him was an HIV test. In subsequent police interviews, S. recalled the ‘incredible shock’ and confusion of that moment, explaining that she had never intended to file a criminal complaint against Assange, that the arrest warrant was far beyond anything she could ever have imagined, and that it was the opposite of what Inspector Wassgren had promised, namely, that nothing would happen for ages, so she should not worry but try to relax. At 6:30 p.m. she writes another text message, this time to a friend: ‘Did I do the right thing going to the police? He has been detained [i.e. through an arrest warrant in his absence] for raping me and sexual assault (I think) against the Sosse girl.’ This friend will later testify that S. ‘felt that she had been run over by the police and others.’ According to Inspector Krans’s closing remarks in the protocol, after learning about the arrest warrant against Assange, S. can hardly concentrate. Therefore, at 6:40 p.m. Krans decides to suspend the interview with her. S. leaves the police station without reading or approving the written version of her interview as summarized by Inspector Krans – the same police officer who had registered a criminal report for the rape of S. in the computer system before even talking to her and who, six days later, would modify S.’s statement without consulting her. At this point, right after her interview, S. still seems to desperately cling to the original plan proposed by A., namely, to try and prevent the opening of a criminal investigation by refusing to sign her own statement.

According to A.’s own account, Krans is keen to question her immediately after S. and asks her by phone to come back to the police station for a formal interview. A. responds that she is already on a train to Uppsala and would prefer to do the interview another day. Krans cautions that, in this case, it might not be her who conducts the interview. While A. seems to prefer not to be interviewed by a police officer who is also a friend or acquaintance, Inspector Krans does not appear to perceive her personal relationship with A. as presenting a potential conflict of interest. In the course of the following weeks, Krans repeatedly expresses extreme bias against Assange in social media, which eventually triggers a formal conflict-of-interest complaint against Inspector Krans to the Swedish ombudsman for the judiciary. In a breathtakingly superficial, naïve and self-defeating decision of 23 May 2011, the ombudsman dismisses the complaint, stating that the police and Prosecution Authority themselves had found Inspector Krans’s conduct to be without fault and that, therefore, the ombudsman has no reason to further investigate the matter.

#### Suppression of Exculpatory Evidence

Chapter 23, Section 4 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure states: ‘At the preliminary investigation, not only circumstances that are not in favour of the suspect but also circumstances in his favour shall be considered, and any evidence favourable to the suspect shall be preserved.’ In the light of this provision, it is particularly revealing how the Swedish authorities suppressed or sidelined text messages sent by A. and S., the content of which often diametrically contradicts the official narrative disseminated by the authorities. While it is on record that the text messages stored in the personal mobile phones of the two women were seized by the police – for S. on 10 September 2010, for A. on 27 January 2011 – these messages were subsequently classified as ‘secret’ by the prosecutor and not even handed over to Assange’s defence attorneys. The standard response of the prosecutor was that releasing the text messages would jeopardize the investigation. It took more than a year for Assange’s lawyers, Thomas Olsson and Per Samuelson, to gain access to the messages and, even then, the modalities and restrictions imposed by the prosecutor were so prohibitive that the effective use of these messages as exculpatory evidence was rendered virtually impossible.

On 8 December 2011, Olsson and Samuelson were invited to the office of Chief Police Investigator Mats Gehlin to inspect several hundred printed messages he had pre-selected for them from S.’s cell phone. However, the two lawyers were not allowed to copy the messages, to transcribe them by hand or to make any notes on their content except for the date and time they were sent or received. According to the prosecutor, these restrictions were necessary for reasons of data protection and privacy – rights to which the Swedish authorities attached considerably less importance vis-à-vis Assange. This led to the bizarre situation that, in a modern democracy like Sweden, Assange’s attorneys were forced to memorize exculpatory text messages and try to write down their content immediately afterwards, naturally without being able to reproduce the exact wording in every case. In view of these difficulties, the precision of their transcripts, some of which I have been able to compare with original sources, is remarkable.

Even four years later, on 16 July 2014, Assange’s lawyers were prohibited from filing a printed copy of these messages as evidence to the Swedish District Court on the grounds that they had been classified by the Prosecution Authority. The same pretext for suppressing the text messages was given – and accepted – at the Court of Appeal. In consequence, even the Swedish judges, tasked with deciding on the extension of the arrest warrant against Assange, were not given access to these text messages and so had to reach their verdict relying on unverifiable claims of the prosecution. One does not need to be a law professor to understand that tactics such as these severely undermine due process safeguards and fair trial guarantees.

It was only in 2019, after their investigation had been reopened for the third time, that the Swedish Prosecution Authority produced an official English translation of those text messages from S.’s mobile phone which it acknowledged to be ‘relevant for the investigation’. However, from the index numbers of the listed messages, it can be seen that there are numerous gaps where one or several messages were withheld. Most importantly, twelve messages sent or received by S. between 2:32 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. on 20 August (index 3994-4005) are missing. This is precisely the period when S. was at the police station and very upset about the rape narrative imposed on her. As mentioned earlier, we know from the transcripts made by Assange’s lawyers in 2011, and from S.’s own testimony during her second police interview of 2 September 2010, that S. sent a message to A. at 5:06 p.m., expressing her shock at the news about the arrest warrant. Despite its obvious importance for Assange’s defence, this message was deliberately suppressed by the Swedish Prosecution Authority. There is a second, particularly significant gap of sixty-six messages sent or received from 7:36 a.m. on 21 August (when the women started exchanging messages expressing strong disagreement with the official rape narrative published in the media) until 3:31 p.m. on 23 August when the women finally had been assigned a legal counsel fiercely promoting precisely that narrative (index 4018-4083).

By deliberately withholding exculpatory or mitigating evidence, the Swedish authorities not only violated Assange’s procedural rights as set out in the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure but, in conjunction with their aggressive dissemination of the rape allegations, may even have committed the criminal offence of false accusation.

#### Headline: ‘Julian Assange Hounded on Suspicion of Rape’

But Friday, 20 August 2010, the day of the women’s visit to the police station, is not over yet. In the evening, a journalist – who was attending a crayfish party with the inner circle of Sweden’s political leadership at the time – learns of the arrest warrant against Assange on probable cause of rape. It is not known who leaked the information and whether it was leaked directly to the journalist, or whether the police or Prosecution Authority informally alerted key figures in the political leadership, who then tipped off the journalist at the party. Either way, the circle of possible culprits for the original leak is small.

The journalist immediately passes the information on to a colleague at the tabloid *Expressen*, and *Expressen* does what any tabloid paper would do: they call the prosecutor, Maria Häljebo Kjellstrand, that same Friday evening. Is it true that she has issued an arrest warrant against Julian Assange? The inconceivable happens: Kjellstrand loquaciously confirms to *Expressen* not only that an arrest warrant has been issued against Assange, but also that there is probable cause of rape (*på sannolika skäl misstänkt för våldtäkt*) involving two victims. Has she spoken to the women? No, she has not. Nor does she know when the rape complaint was made – she herself received it from the police just an hour ago. No, she has no idea where Assange is and whether he is being searched for, but she hopes and assumes that this is the case. Having said all that, Kjellstrand then concludes that, in consideration of all those involved, she can say ‘absolutely nothing’ (*inte nånting*) about the case at this time.

*Expressen* further specifies that the women allegedly did not want to file a criminal complaint. ‘The women are scared to death [*är livrädda*] and therefore do not dare to cooperate. In this case, the police believe that the reason for their fear is the position of power of the perpetrator [*gärningsmannen*].’ And so, with the stroke of a pen, the non-violent ‘suspect’ has become a menacing ‘perpetrator’. No mention of mere suspicion, no hint of the presumption of innocence and, above all, no resemblance to what the women had reported to have experienced. Another source, described by *Expressen* as a ‘person close to the women’ (*person nära kvinnorna*), seemed to have a great deal of detailed knowledge, namely that the alleged victims were aged between twenty and thirty, that they know each other, and that one of the alleged offences was committed on Tuesday morning in Enköping and the other on the previous weekend in an apartment in Södermalm.

To make matters worse, two days later, on Monday, 23 August, the police releases part of their investigative case file to the Swedish press in prompt response to a freedom of information request. The thirty-nine-page fax, sent between 4:28 and 4:30 p.m., includes the original summaries of the interviews with S. (from p. 7) and A. (from p. 18). While sensitive information has been largely redacted, the police have failed to redact A.’s name and surname from the title of her interview summary, thus revealing her full identity to the press. But the publication of all this information now also makes it impossible for S. to remain anonymous, and soon the identities of both women are common knowledge.

The Swedish authorities know, of course, that their indiscretion will expose both Assange and the two women to a relentless media circus and needlessly undermine the objectivity of the investigation. However, neither the privacy and protection of the individuals concerned nor the effectiveness of the investigation seem to be a priority for the officials in charge. According to Sven-Erik Alhem, former chief prosecutor and director of public prosecution in Stockholm and Malmö, the authorities’ indiscretion clearly violated the applicable Swedish Secrecy Act (2009:400), according to which the identity of those involved in a preliminary investigation must be kept confidential unless and until charges are brought. The same opinion is shared by Brita Sundberg-Weitman, a former law professor, appeal judge and president of the Solna District Court, who, like Alhem, has written an expert report for Assange’s defence lawyers detailing some of the most notorious due process violations that have tarnished the Swedish preliminary investigation against him.

The legal situation is clear – the Swedish authorities violated not only their specific duty of confidentiality, but also their general duty of care as expressly set out in Chapter 23 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure: ‘The investigation should be conducted so that no person is unnecessarily exposed to suspicion or put to unnecessary expense or inconvenience.’ From the start, the authorities themselves seriously undermined the objectivity and effectiveness of the investigation. They publicly disclosed Assange’s identity without any evidence for his criminal culpability, without any imminent danger or temporal urgency, without having formally interviewed either the suspect or the alleged victims, and without any consideration for the harm likely to result from their indiscretion to everyone involved. This course of action also disproved the credibility of their purported justification for the arrest warrant, namely that Assange was a flight risk. Had such a risk really existed, no prosecutor in their right mind would have publicly announced the arrest warrant in the mass media, thus giving the suspect an advance warning he could not possibly miss. Unless, of course, their real intention was to provoke Assange’s flight as a means of obtaining probative evidence for his culpability.

In any case, neither Prosecutor Kjellstrand nor anyone else was ever held accountable for a breach of duty, nor were any disciplinary measures taken. A complaint was reportedly filed with the Swedish ombudsman for the judiciary who, once again, swiftly found a boilerplate excuse for evading his official responsibilities – this time, he reportedly did not wish to interfere with an ongoing proceeding. Given that all the judiciary really does is to conduct investigative and judicial proceedings, it is rather hard to conceive of a case where the ombudsman could exercise effective parliamentary oversight over the judiciary without ‘interfering’ with an ongoing investigation or proceeding. As already demonstrated in the cases of Inspector Krans and the unlawful rendition of Agiza and Al Zery, the ombudsman’s record of ex post facto investigating and confronting official misconduct does not seem any brighter, at least not when overriding national security interests are involved.

Early on Saturday, 21 August 2010, the day after the police interview, around 5 a.m., *Expressen*’s headline reads: ‘WikiLeaks Julian Assange hounded on suspicion of rape in Sweden’ [*Wikileaks Julian Assange jagas misstänkt för våldtäkt i Sverige*]. Within minutes, the news rockets around the world. Assange himself learns it from the press and reacts at 9:15 a.m. on the Twitter channel of WikiLeaks: ‘We were warned to expect “dirty tricks”. Now we see the first one.’ By now, at the latest, the two women must have understood that control over their own story had been snatched from them. Within less than twenty-four hours, their attempt to use the police to pressure Assange into taking an HIV test had backfired and triggered an avalanche of unforeseen events that could no longer be stopped. The SMS correspondence of the two women bear witness to the tremendous pressure they suddenly find themselves exposed to. Already at 7:09 on Saturday morning, S. writes to a friend, ‘I feel awful. It’s already in the news even though it was supposed to be confidential. I have to choose a lawyer, “a reputable name, criminal lawyer, preferably a man”, the police said. Help!’ And then, when asked what was in the press, she writes: ‘That one of the offences was committed in Enköping. Bloody police! It was supposed to be confidential and we said we didn’t want to submit a report.’ Almost simultaneously comes a text message, whose sender is blacked out, but which only A. could have written: ‘It’s in the media now, check out *Expressen*. Bloody hell. I don’t know what to do other than be quiet and turn off my phone.’ S. replies at 7:33 a.m., ‘I know, I am in a total panic. Fuck, I don’t want to be part of this. I wish I could flee the country.’ A. replies at 7:36, ‘Take it easy dear, no one knows you are involved, right?’

As indicated earlier, the next sixty-six text messages sent or received by S., some of which reportedly provided clear evidence for S.’s disagreement with the official narrative imposed on her, have been deliberately withheld from Assange’s defence lawyers by the Swedish Prosecution Authority. The official trail of messages picks up only fifty-seven hours later, once the two women had been assigned a legal counsel bent on aggressively pursuing precisely that narrative. A small number of messages transcribed by Assange’s lawyers nevertheless testify to the fundamental transformation of attitude forced onto A. and S. during this period of radio silence.

Not surprisingly, after the initial shock, the two women soon realize that they have no choice but to come to terms with the new reality. On Saturday evening, 21 August, at 10:25 p.m., S. still complains in a transcribed text message that it was the ‘police who made up the charges’. But by Monday morning, 23 August, her tone has changed. Again according to the lawyers’ own transcription, at 6:43 a.m., A. wrote to S. that it was important that she – S. – went public with her story so that they could mobilize public opinion for their case. Then on Thursday, 26 August, at 1:38 p.m., A. suggested to S. that they ought to sell their stories to a newspaper, and on 28 August, at 12:53 p.m., reported that they had a contact at the largest Swedish tabloid. S. reportedly replied on the same day, at 3:59 p.m., that their lawyer was negotiating with the tabloid. Caution should be exercised when interpreting this correspondence. Given the circumstances, I do not believe that the motivation for these messages was primarily monetary, but rather that they reflect a desperate attempt by the women to somehow keep the ‘upper hand’ in a situation where they had already been effectively stripped of all influence and control – a common compensatory pattern shown by people who have been cornered.

Given the scandalous headlines and the official confirmation given by the authorities, a differentiated account of what the women had experienced with Julian Assange was no longer possible. In the eyes of the broader public, Assange was either a rapist or he had been falsely accused – there was no longer any space for grey zones, for misunderstandings, for accidents, or for alternative explanations. A. and S. had to choose: would they jump on the bandwagon of the official rape narrative and, in return, be able to count on the full support of the public authorities? Or would they challenge the official rape narrative, inevitably raising questions as to why they had visited the police station in the first place and, possibly, inviting criminal complaints for false accusation or defamation as well as financial claims? In the latter case, the two women would have to face not only the wrath of Assange and his devoted entourage, of which they themselves had been an integral part just twenty-four hours earlier, but they would also be abandoned by the Swedish authorities and exposed to severe criticism by the press, if not the entire world public.

When evaluating the behaviour and statements of A. and S., therefore, due consideration must always be given to the fact that, through no fault of their own, they have been under enormous pressure to conform to the official rape narrative ever since the first *Expressen* headlines and until today. Accordingly, from this point on, the women’s original concern – the HIV test – all but disappears, even in their private text messages and correspondence. Their primary trauma now no longer seems to be a possible HIV infection, but the relentless media hype and the threats and abuse they receive on social media. Had the authorities complied with their duty of confidentiality as required by Swedish law, this investigation would have disappeared into the archives of the Swedish Prosecution Authority after only a few days. But that was not what the Swedish authorities appeared to have in mind.

#### The Questioning of A.

Just a few hours after the *Expressen* shock, on Saturday, 21 August, at 11:31 a.m., the first formal police interview of A. takes place – by phone. This is an important detail, because the initial questioning of a possible rape victim should never be conducted on the phone. It is not only a matter of reliably identifying the person being questioned, but also of being able to identify and address situations of anxiety or distress which may not be expressed verbally, but rather through body language, facial expressions and gestures. It must have been clear to the police that A. was under intense pressure at the time of the interview and could not be properly questioned over the phone. By this point, the authorities had already informed the whole world in no uncertain terms how her experience with Assange was to be legally categorized: ‘Rape, alternatively sexual harassment’ were the crimes referenced at the top of the interview summary written by Inspector Sara Wennerblom.

Just as with S., the initial interview of A. is not witnessed by a second officer and is not recorded on tape but is merely summarized by the questioning inspector in her own words. This is clearly contrary to standard professional practice, as it makes it impossible to verify whether the initial testimonies used against the suspect have been influenced by leading questions or implicit expectations. An unfortunate coincidence? No, because this is exactly how the police will proceed for the initial questioning of all seven witnesses who are either friends or relatives of the two women and, therefore, likely to be supportive of them. None of these statements are made in the presence of a second police officer, none of them are recorded on tape, and none are reproduced verbatim, but merely summarized in the words of the interviewing officer. As the police are very well aware, these witnesses perceive the authorities as acting in the interest of the two women and so are unlikely to question or correct the precise manner or wording in which their statements are summarized by the interviewing officer.

Conversely, Assange’s own interview is conducted by the book in the presence of a second police officer, is duly recorded on tape and reproduced verbatim. Assange, of course, is unlikely to accept a freely paraphrased summary of his statement, and he is accompanied by his defence lawyer, who gives the authorities no wiggle room. Likewise, the interviews of Donald Boström and Johannes Wahlström are both conducted in the presence of a second police officer, recorded on tape and reproduced in their original wording. Boström and Wahlström are both experienced journalists, who have a neutral attitude towards the involved parties, choose their words carefully and insist on their verbatim recording.

A. herself does not contradict Inspector Wennerblom’s summary of her statement. As noted earlier, she is convinced that Assange intentionally ripped his condom during sexual intercourse. She clearly acknowledges, however, that this is only an assumption, that she did not see Assange actually ripping the condom, and that she has not even verified whether the condom, which she still has in her possession at home, really was damaged. In the police summary of her statement, A. further affirms that Assange initially – that is, before their sexual intercourse – prevented her from reaching for a condom ‘by holding her arms and prying open her legs while trying to penetrate her […] without a condom’. But then, ‘after a moment, Assange asked [A.] what she was doing and why she was squeezing her legs together. [A.] then told him that she wanted him to wear a condom before he came in her. At that, Assange released [A.]’s arms and put on a condom that [A.] fetched for him.’ The telephone interview of A. ends at 12:20 p.m.

Just three and a half hours later, at 3:55, another major Swedish newspaper, *Aftonbladet*, publishes an interview with A. in which she partially corrects the *Expressen* article: ‘It is absolutely wrong to say that we did not want to report Assange because we were afraid of him. He is not violent, and I don’t feel threatened by him.’ A. emphasizes that she sees herself as a victim of sexual coercion or harassment, but not of rape. Contrary to S.’s own testimony and text messages, however, A. consistently claims that S. wanted to file a criminal report for rape, while A. had merely accompanied her in order to support S. with her own testimony. According to A., the allegations against Assange were not orchestrated by the Pentagon, of course, but were the responsibility of a man with a ‘distorted image of women’ and difficulties ‘taking “no” for an answer’. However, at least according to the written summary of her police interview given earlier that morning, ‘Assange made sexual advances to her every day after the evening when they had sex’ and A. ‘had rejected him on every such occasion, which Assange had accepted’ in each case – that is to say, her ‘no’.

#### First Discontinuation of Investigation

Barely half an hour after A.’s interview in *Aftonbladet*, the case takes another dramatic turn. The Swedish attorney general, concerned that the case was too sensitive to be left to a duty prosecutor’s care until Monday, transmits the written summaries of the two police interviews to Eva Finné, chief prosecutor for Stockholm, for review. Finné reacts quickly. Around 4:30 on Saturday afternoon, she cancels the arrest warrant issued by Kjellstrand the evening before and releases a press statement: ‘I do not believe there is any reason to suspect him of rape.’ Given that the Prosecution Authority had already caused a worldwide media flurry by publicly confirming both the arrest warrant against Assange and the probable cause of rape, Finné must have been very confident in her assessment to perform such a rapid and dramatic U-turn. She knew, of course, that her decision was sure to be painstakingly scrutinized by powerful stakeholders with vested interests. Therefore, based on the original written summaries of the police interviews with A. and S., it must have been plainly evident to any experienced prosecutor that the crime of rape, as defined in the Swedish criminal code in 2010, could be excluded in both cases. For the time being, Finné does not want to rule out sexual harassment in either case, but this reduces the minimum sentence below the threshold of one year’s imprisonment, which is generally required for an arrest warrant.

In the case of S., Finné even proceeds to drop the investigation altogether only a few days later, on 25 August 2010. The official press release reads: ‘As previously announced, the information obtained from interviewing [S.] is such that the suspicion of rape no longer exists. This does not mean that I do not believe her statements. I have studied the content of the interview to see whether there is any suspicion of another offence, primarily harassment or sexual harassment, but my analysis shows that this is not the case. The investigation is therefore closed as far as this complaint is concerned, as there is no suspicion of a crime.’ The communiqué concludes by affirming that, in the case of A., ‘the suspicion of molestation remains. I will instruct the investigator to interview the suspect’.

Finné’s impending discontinuation of S.’s case had become foreseeable with her lifting of the arrest warrant over the weekend. Accordingly, on Monday, 23 August, S.’s text messages begin to express growing concern. Already during her interview on Friday evening, the police had recommended that she take a lawyer, ‘a reputable name, a criminal defence lawyer, preferably a man’. Now, on Monday, S. and A. will be assigned a legal counsel fitting this description perfectly. Claes Borgström is an ambitious lawyer who has earned his political credentials as the Swedish government’s equality ombudsman and is standing for the Social Democratic Party in the upcoming parliamentary elections of September 2010.

However, earlier that year, he had received disastrous press coverage and later would even be subjected to an – ultimately inconsequential – disciplinary investigation by the Swedish Bar Association for his controversial role as defence counsel in what has been described as the biggest judicial scandal in Swedish history. Borgström’s client, Sture Bergwall, aka Thomas Quick, a drug-addicted psychiatric patient, had voluntarily confessed to thirty-three unresolved murders – each of which he had, it later transpired, read about in the newspapers. He was convicted in eight cases and considered the biggest serial killer in Sweden. Despite the lack of reliable evidence and motives, the credibility of Quick’s confessions was never questioned by the police, the prosecutor or the courts, and not even by Borgström, his own defence counsel. In a spooky preview of what was to come in the Assange investigation, police interviews were manipulated, and contradictory or exculpatory evidence was suppressed in order to support the authorities’ preferred narrative of Quick as the mentally deranged serial killer. It took a ninth murder prosecution, the tireless work of investigative journalist Hannes Råstam, and the sober eye of an experienced chief prosecutor – Eva Finné – to expose and terminate this grotesque travesty of justice in May 2010. As a result, Bergwall withdrew all his fantasized confessions, replaced his defence counsel, was acquitted on all counts and, after twenty years of confinement, was released an innocent man. Clearly, this outcome was bad press for Borgström and bad news for his political ambitions. In August 2010, then, he urgently needed a high-profile case with which to rehabilitate and polish his reputation with a view to the upcoming parliamentary elections, which were just weeks away. The Assange case, with Chief Prosecutor Eva Finné on the opposing end, must have been a perfect match.

On the Monday following the Friday police interview, 23 August 2010, at 4:31 p.m., S. sends the following text message: ‘Claes Borgström is my lawyer now. Hope he can help me get out of this shit.’ In Sweden, it is standard practice for the state to assign a public legal counsel to alleged crime victims, at least in more complex cases. Invited by the court to comment on Borgström’s request, Chief Prosecutor Finné only writes: ‘I have no objections to the appointment of legal counsel to the injured party. This is justified in view of mass media attention.’ Finné’s unequivocal abandonment of the rape narrative must have been deeply unsettling to the two women. After all, only twenty-four hours earlier, the same rape narrative had been forcefully imposed on them at the Klara police station, only after having been dismissed by another police officer via telephone a few hours earlier. Given this dizzying back and forth, the women cannot be blamed for being confused. For them, however, the primary burden does not appear to be any alleged misconduct by Assange, but their unwarranted public exposure in conjunction with the uncertainty resulting from the constantly changing official narrative. Tellingly, in her text message, S. does not express the hope that Borgström will help her to obtain ‘justice’, or to make Assange take an HIV test, but that he will get her ‘out of this shit’. Given that both criminal reports falsely state that it was the women who, on their own initiative, filed a criminal complaint against Assange, they may also have become worried about a possible complaint against them for false accusation, defamation or other legal claims relating to reputational damage.

On Monday, 23 August, Inspector Mats Gehlin, to whom the case has just been assigned, writes a memo stating that, in S.’s case, the elements of rape are fulfilled. However, in A.’s case, he notes that there might be a ‘deception’ (*vilseledande*), and that it is unclear whether there is any offence at all. The reason for this assumption is redacted. Exactly one week later, on 30 August, Chief Prosecutor Eva Finné issues an order stating that a criminal complaint for false accusation will not be acted upon, for lack of sufficient evidence of the crime. The complaint was submitted the day after the *Expressen* headline, on Sunday, 22 August, and assigned the file number belonging to the preliminary investigation against Assange. The Swedish authorities have not disclosed who had lodged the complaint and against whom.

Still on that Monday, in the afternoon, the following text messages are exchanged between S. and a friend: ‘No. My lawyer takes care of everything so I can’t comment. Will try to work this week.’ Unfortunately, we are not told what exactly S. cannot comment on – the immediately preceding text message (index 4087) has been picked out and suppressed by the Swedish Prosecution Authority. In any case, her friend writes back, ‘Oh you’ve sued him. That’s great. I hope the swine gets what he deserves.’ S. replies, ‘No, the police got it all started, I didn’t want to be part of it, but now I have no choice …’ There really is no better way to explain the coercion of the two women into conforming with the official rape narrative than through these desperate words sent out by S. that afternoon.

#### ‘Necessary changes’ to S.’s Interview

On the same Monday, 23 August, Inspector Irmeli Krans wants to edit her summary of S.’s interview. Krans had written the summary with the help of the text creation program in the police’s own DurTvå system immediately after the – rather abrupt – end of S.’s interview on Friday evening. But when she returned to the office after the weekend, the system denied her access to her own summary. Inspector Gehlin provides the explanation the same morning at 10:26 a.m. in an email to Chief Prosecutor Finné: ‘Hello Eva, I have been given the honour of handling this case. […] Journalists are calling from all corners of the world!!! I have extended access protection in DurTvå. Need a secrecy stamp on the case. Everyone wants the police report’.

Apparently, Gehlin’s first official act after taking over the preliminary investigation against Assange had been to restrict internal access in the system and, curiously, to exclude Krans. At 4:28 that afternoon, a redacted copy of S.’s original interview summary is faxed to a Swedish press contact, reportedly in – rather prompt – response to a freedom of information request. On that fax copy, the decisive passages describing the alleged sexual misconduct have been redacted. The original, unredacted version appears to have been eliminated from the official investigative case documents archived by the authorities and – presumably – no longer exists. On the next day, 24 August, Inspector Gehlin logs the following memo: ‘Spoke with Eva Finné. She does not believe it is rape. Inform her that I do not agree, but that it is her case. She told me not to take action until she has read through the case documents. Interview of injured party to Claes Borgström.’

So, according to Inspector Gehlin’s diary, Borgström obtains a copy of S.’s original interview by the latest on 24 August – something Assange’s lawyer will be denied for months to come – and also meets personally with the two women. Borgström’s intention is clear. He does not want to accept the impending closure of the preliminary investigation in the case of S. and intends to appeal Finné’s decision to the next hierarchical level, the director of public prosecution. But this requires strong arguments. Given the worldwide media attention and the public scrutiny of her handling of the case, Finné would have examined the material particularly carefully before cancelling the arrest warrant and then officially dropping the entire case of S. for lack of evidence of any criminal conduct. Had Finné harboured even the slightest doubt, she might still have dropped the arrest warrant but would certainly have allowed the preliminary investigation to continue for a few days, at least for a less serious offence, until Assange could be formally interviewed. As explained by Kjellstrand on Sunday, 22 August, in an interview with *Expressen*, Swedish prosecutors do not normally reverse each other’s decisions except on the basis of new facts.

Borgström’s complaint against Finné’s decision will be addressed to the competent higher authority: Director of Public Prosecution Marianne Ny in Gothenburg, a personal friend of Borgström’s. When Borgström receives the original interview with S., he knows it has not yet been read and approved by S. and can still be amended or corrected. Inspector Krans, who is tasked with editing the text of S.’s interview, will on 25 August appear on Facebook describing the discontinuation of that case by Chief Prosecutor Eva Finné as a ‘SCANDAAAAAAAAL!!!!!’, and expressing her delight that ‘our dear, eminent and highly competent Claes Borgström will hopefully bring some order.’ Inspector Gehlin, her superior, has also made clear in his diary that he disagrees with Finné’s decision.

It is against this background that the following email exchange between Inspectors Gehlin and Krans takes place from 23 to 26 August, and for which the Swedish authorities have refused to provide any explanation. On 23 August, at 8:27 a.m., Krans writes: ‘Hello, I hope I have done it right now and the document reaches you as it should. Please send me a confirmation. Regarding the verbal report to the prosecutor, I only know that it was made by Linda Wassgren by phone sometime during the interview [i.e. the original police report to Prosecutor Kjellstrand on the afternoon of 20 August while S. was still being interviewed by Krans]. What was reported is unknown to me, as Wassgren did not want to communicate with me. There was no opportunity to discuss the crime classification with the prosecutor, but I was told that it should be classified as rape on the instructions of the prosecutor.’

Why didn’t Wassgren want to communicate with Krans? Why was Krans excluded from the investigation of this case, despite the fact that she was the only officer who had actually spoken with S. in detail and had heard the precise words of her original statement? Despite? Or perhaps rather because of it? It is not until one day later, at 9:33 a.m., that Gehlin responds: ‘Good morning Irmeli! Proceed as follows. Copy this into an interview and sign the interview. It would look strange if I signed it. I attach the old interview.’ Krans, an experienced police officer after all, is at a loss. At 1:38 p.m., she replies: ‘I may be dim, but I don’t really understand what you mean.’ Gehlin replies just six minutes later. ‘Create a new interview. Add the text and assign the interview to the case file. Sign the interview, too.’ Krans’s confusion persists: ‘Sure, but then there are two interviews. But only one formal interview has been conducted, by me anyway. So where does the second interview go? If everything is to be done correctly, I suppose I must make the changes in the original interview and then sign it. At the risk of appearing to be difficult, I do not want an unsigned document with my name on it circulating in DurTvå space. Especially not now that the matter has evolved in this way.’ It is not until two days later, on Thursday, 26 August at 12:30 p.m., after an email exchange with Claes Borgström, that Gehlin concludes his correspondence with Krans with the assurance, ‘Yes, but I’ll write a memo about it.’ Two hours later, Krans generates S.’s new interview in the DurTvå system, replacing the original document. The next day, on 27 August, Borgström will join this revised interview to a complaint submitted to Prosecutor Marianne Ny requesting the case of S. to be reopened and the allegations in the case of A. to be extended.

While the correspondence between Gehlin and Krans may remain cryptic to outsiders, there can be no doubt that Gehlin asked Krans to do something very unusual, if not suspicious. Krans, whose access to the original interview had been blocked by Gehlin, appears to be confused, reluctant and nervous about not acting correctly. This feeling does not seem to have lessened even several days after Krans had completed her task. When the preliminary investigation in S.’s case is reopened on 1 September, thus making it likely that S.’s interview will be subjected to judicial review, Krans makes sure to attach a memo to the interview at 4:45 p.m. The memo explains that, on Gehlin’s instructions, a new interview with the ‘necessary changes’ was created on 26 August 2010, at 2:43 p.m.; and that this timestamp was automatically adopted by the system as the beginning of the interview, although it had actually been conducted on 20 August, between 4:21 and 6:40 p.m.

What changes exactly were made and why they were ‘necessary’ cannot be determined with certainty, since the original interview has been heavily redacted. In any case, it cannot have been a matter of pure spelling corrections, which would never have triggered such an extensive correspondence and so much discomfort. When one compares the original (but redacted) interview with the revised (but unredacted) version, both of which were printed in the same font and format, it is quite evident that the text has become slightly longer. Depending on whether the black censorship bars extend beyond the text lines printed underneath or reflect their exact length, a total of between one and three lines of text appears to have been inserted in the paragraph describing the alleged sexual misconduct. Where did these ‘necessary changes’ come from? S. had not been consulted, no tape recording had been made of her statement, and no other officer had witnessed the interview. Moreover, six days after the interview, too much time had already passed for reliable corrections to be made based on Inspector Krans’s personal recollection. Why did Gehlin’s request make Krans so nervous? Had someone perhaps suggested alternative wording that would increase the chances of the case being reopened? To encourage a different appreciation of the case by the director of public prosecution, it would not be necessary to substantially change the entire story – slight adjustments in the wording could be enough.

Let us remember that, according to the Swedish criminal code in force at the time, the alleged conduct of Assange could only constitute rape if, at least at the beginning of the sexual act, S. had been asleep, and therefore incapable of giving free and full consent to unprotected sexual intercourse. Thus, whether S.’s interview described her state at the time as being ‘asleep’, ‘half asleep’, or ‘sleepy’, and whether it said that Assange ‘initiated’, ‘attempted’, or had already ‘penetrated’ S. at the relevant moment, are not semantic quibbles, but could have tipped the scales so as to justify – or not – resuscitating the rape allegation against Assange. Given that the original text of S.’s interview was not transcribed verbatim from a tape recording, but had been summarized in Krans’s own words, a subsequent manipulation cannot be ruled out. As long as the Swedish authorities are allowed to hide behind a convenient veil of secrecy, the truth about this dubious episode may never come to light.

#### Shadow Boxing around Condoms and DNA Analyses

In parallel, a bizarre sideshow arises in connection with the condoms used by Assange with the two women and their suitability as evidence to substantiate the rape allegations against him. During her initial phone interview on 21 August, when asked by Inspector Sara Wennerblom, A. says that she believes she still possesses the condom used by Assange during sexual intercourse with her eight days earlier. A. acknowledges that she has not verified whether it is damaged at all but promises to check. She also says that she probably still has the unwashed bedsheet on which Assange’s sperm might be found. On the same day, at 6:21 p.m., Wennerblom personally knocks on A.’s front door and takes the following items into police custody: ‘a sheet, cotton, blue, taken from the laundry basket’ (Exhibit 2010-0201-BG20840-1) as well as a condom, torn, ‘found in the wastepaper basket and put in a box’ (Exhibit 2010-0201-BG20840-2).

S. takes even more time and waits a full sixteen days from the date of the alleged rape before handing over to Inspector Gehlin, during her second interview on 2 September, a torn piece of a condom, which she says to have found under her bed. According to her initial interview twelve days earlier, however, she had returned home to ‘clean up and wash everything’ immediately after Assange had left. She mentioned the presence of semen on the bedsheets but, at least according to the summary written by Inspector Krans, does not appear to have found the piece of condom at that time. According to a memo written by Gehlin another six weeks later, on 20 October 2010, S. allegedly had not noticed in the darkness that a condom had been damaged, but she heard a sound as if he were ‘pulling a balloon’ when he put the condom on. It is striking to see how the stories of A. and S. begin to converge over time. In the original interview, only A. had spoken of a torn condom and strange sounds of snapping latex. Now, with the Prosecution Authority running out of promising investigative steps to be taken in support of their allegations against Assange, the same elements suddenly start appearing in the case of S. as well.

Such ‘evidentiary harmonization’ is a form of confirmation bias resulting from deliberate or inadvertent suggestive questioning, or from mutual witness influence. It is quite common in investigations where the same officials are tasked with interviewing several witnesses and tend to use leading questions to elicit the elements they are looking for. In the present case, it suggests an attempt by the authorities to strengthen the evidentiary value of the two interviews by ‘harmonizing’ some of their components. Such manipulative methods of questioning had reportedly been used extensively during the police investigation of the Bergwall/Quick case in order to gloss over serious evidential contradictions and confirm the misdirected ‘mass murderer’ narrative favoured by the authorities.

On 24 August, Chief Prosecutor Finné requests a forensic examination of the condom submitted by A. with a view to determining how it had been damaged. Inspector Gehlin hands the condom over to the technical service of the police. The service is unable to answer the question and passes the task on to the State Forensic Laboratory, SKL. The condom fragment submitted by S. is likewise handed over to the laboratory to determine how exactly it was damaged. In its report of 25 October 2010, SKL offers the initial results of its analysis. At the same time it issues an express disclaimer clarifying that it lacks the accreditation – required under the industry standard (ISO/IEC17025) – for investigating the actual question before it, namely the cause of the damage done to the latex material of the condoms. As the laboratory will confirm in an extensive letter sent to the police on 20 June 2012, it essentially investigated a matter for which it lacked the required standard procedures and specialized expertise. Instead, the laboratory staff intentionally damaged the condom submitted by A. with a knife, with scissors, and by ripping off its lower part. When comparing the three types of damage under the microscope, the one resulting from ripping off part of the condom showed the greatest similarity with the pre-existing damage. The same opinion was reached about the condom fragment submitted by S. The official conclusion was that, in both cases, the observed damage had been caused by the condom being ripped. The probability level for this hypothesis was said to be ‘+2’, which means that there is a ‘small’ probability that the laboratory’s conclusion is wrong. On the scale of forensic probative value, this is situated at the lower medium level of strength: one level above mere circumstantial evidence (+1), and two levels below evidence capable of excluding other hypotheses (+4). As would be expected, however, the laboratory was unable to determine who had ripped the condoms, at what point in time, and whether the damage had been caused deliberately or accidentally.

Equally unsurprisingly, on the condom fragment provided by S. the laboratory found S.’s DNA, as well as that of a man. Although the authorities continue to keep the identity of this man secret, it can reasonably be assumed to be Assange. After all, neither Assange nor S. have disputed that they had repeatedly and voluntarily engaged in sexual intercourse during which condoms had been used. Both also agree that, during their last sexual intercourse, which gave rise to the rape allegation, Assange did not wear a condom from the beginning. So, whatever had happened to the condom fragment submitted by S., it was entirely irrelevant to the rape allegation made against Assange. In the case of S., the only question to be investigated was whether their unprotected intercourse was initiated by Assange while S. was helpless due to sleep – a question which even the best forensic expert could not be expected to answer.

The laboratory had significantly more trouble finding DNA on the condom submitted by A. According to Inspector Gehlin’s memo of 20 October 2010, the laboratory initially could not detect any DNA whatsoever. Eight days later, on 28 October, Gehlin corrects himself in another, much more elaborate memo: he had now had the opportunity to discuss the results of the DNA analyses with the SKL. The forensic scientist had explained that it was not correct to state that no DNA had been found on A.’s condom, because ‘something’ had been seen, but it had not been possible to interpret it. Gehlin goes on to list a number of possible reasons for these interpretative difficulties which, according to the scientist, included: interference with the analysis due to contamination, etc.; small amount of DNA; people leaving varying amounts of DNA substrate; the material under examination having been washed, dried or otherwise affected after it was used. Gehlin made sure to mention that these were just some examples, and other factors could also have affected the result. In view of the nature of the item here – a condom that allegedly had been worn and torn during intercourse – these explanations seem rather far-fetched and reveal preferences that can hardly be reconciled with objective fact-finding. In any case, as Gehlin noted, the laboratory decided to carry out an additional, more refined DNA analysis which would take another two weeks to complete. The methodology to be followed was the highly complex ‘Low Copy Number’ (LCN) procedure, which can be applied to extremely small trace elements and incomplete DNA fragments, but which often produces much less reliable results and is therefore not accepted as forensic evidence in the courts of most states.

The projected two weeks turn into more than eight months before the laboratory finally renders its final report on 15 July 2011. The report states that on one side of the condom, DNA had been detected that could be matched to a person. The next three explanatory lines are crossed out with a thick censoring pen and followed by the indicated probability level of ‘+2’. Again: one level above circumstantial evidence (+1), and two levels below evidence capable of excluding other hypotheses (+4) – in any case much weaker than a standard DNA analysis, where probative values of 99.999 per cent and above are quite common.

Before getting carried away with forensic technicalities, however, let us pause for a moment and use our common sense. In the cases of both A. and S., it is worth asking exactly what factual allegations or circumstances these DNA analyses were supposed to prove. Just as in the case of S., Assange acknowledged that sexual intercourse with A. had occurred and that a condom had been used. He only denied having ripped the condom intentionally. Therefore, even a perfectly reliable DNA match based on an abundant DNA substrate – which would have to be expected on a used condom – would only prove that A. had actually submitted the condom that had been used together with Assange. Whether the condom was torn intentionally or accidentally, by whom and at what time, are questions that defy forensic determination – certainly within the parameters of the given circumstances. In this respect, Assange claims that he was not even aware that the condom had been damaged, whereas A. is sure that he ripped it on purpose. A. acknowledges, however, that this is a mere assumption and that she did not see him destroy the condom. Even during her police interview, one week later, she still does not know whether the condom is damaged at all, although she still has it in her possession. It is quite clear that, until her police interview on 21 August, neither Assange nor A. seem to have been sufficiently preoccupied with this question to at least verify whether the condom – which for a whole week lay in the trash can of the apartment where they were staying together – was damaged or not.

The police also task the laboratory with examining the stain on A.’s bedsheet for DNA and semen. Here, too, the evidentiary added value remains unclear. During their interviews, both A. and Assange have confirmed that they noticed and commented on this stain shortly after sexual intercourse, but did not give it any importance and so did not pursue the matter further. As the police know very well, the decisive question of whether the condom was ripped intentionally or accidentally cannot be clarified by this analysis either. It is therefore no coincidence that Gehlin did not request the laboratory to conduct this analysis until six months after the alleged events, on 1 March 2011.

The trigger for the belated request must have been that, one week earlier, the Swedish extradition request for Assange had been approved by Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London. Depending on whether the High Court would accept to hear Assange’s appeal, his imminent extradition to Sweden had become a realistic possibility. This had abruptly increased the pressure on Prosecutor Marianne Ny. Suddenly, she might have now to present sufficient evidence to the court in support of an indictment of Assange, failing which he would have to be released and cleared of all allegations. As a result, the police and Prosecution Authority start scrambling for circumstantial and technical elements which could help to gloss over the precarious lack of prosecutable evidence in support of the official rape narrative. From a professional investigative perspective, the Swedish prosecutor must have been fully aware not only of the evidentiary irrelevance of all these laboratory tests, but also of the fact that, in reality, there had never been any prospect of a successful conviction. The only conceivable motivation for undertaking such pointless efforts is that this forensic hyperactivity was to serve as a smokescreen to persuade the judges and the public that a serious criminal investigation was underway which required Assange’s extradition, detention and indictment.

Let us recall that, regardless of whatever took place between Assange and the two women, in both cases his criminal liability depended entirely on factors that objectively could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt. In the case of S., the only decisive question was whether she had been asleep or awake at the first moment of sexual contact initiated by Assange. In the case of A., Assange’s criminal culpability depended exclusively on whether, during sexual intercourse with A., he had ripped his condom intentionally or accidentally. As soon as Assange had publicly denied these allegations in response to the *Expressen* headlines, Chief Prosecutor Finné knew that a criminal investigation would be futile. In the absence of a confession from Assange, who despite his rumoured promiscuity had no history of sexual offences, it was objectively impossible to corroborate the decisive facts. Therefore, a criminal trial would inevitably result in an acquittal based on the benefit of the doubt – most likely followed by claims for reputational damages or even criminal complaints. Indeed, a related criminal complaint for false accusation was filed the day after the *Expressen* headlines, on 22 August 2010. In light of the given evidentiary circumstances, any reasonably experienced prosecutor would have immediately understood that the allegations reported by the police could not be successfully prosecuted. The fact that, nevertheless, the Swedish criminal investigation against Assange was being artificially kept alive by pointless investigative action and endless procrastination strongly suggests that the authorities were not pursuing justice in this case but a completely different, purely political agenda.

Indeed, for years, Sweden will cite the need to take a DNA sample from Assange as one of the main reasons why he cannot be questioned from London by phone or video link but must be extradited to Sweden at all costs. And yet, as early as 7 December 2010, Assange voluntarily gave to the British police a DNA sample which was then stored in the National DNA Database and could be requested by Swedish authorities through mutual legal assistance at any time. But Paul Close from the British Crown Prosecution Service, in an email dated 25 January 2011, specifically advises Marianne Ny against obtaining a DNA sample in the United Kingdom. He begins by stating the obvious: ‘I am not sure if this evidence is really critical.’ Furthermore, he cautions that ‘the obtaining of such evidence could have a greater propensity for harm or mischief by the defence, than it would benefit the prosecution case.’ For the British, too, truth and justice do not seem a priority in this affair: any potentially exculpatory evidence is framed as ‘harm’ or ‘mischief’.

It is not until six years later that Marianne Ny finally brings herself to take this step, when Sweden’s Supreme Court indicates its willingness to lift the arrest warrant against Assange on proportionality grounds due to the lack of progress in the investigation. On 15 December 2016, Sweden finally sends a mutual legal assistance request to the British Central Authority, asking to compare four Swedish DNA profiles with Assange’s personal DNA profile stored in the British registry since 7 December 2010: the first comes from A.’s ripped condom, the second from the stain on A.’s bedsheet, the third from S.’s condom fragment, and the fourth from S.’s vaginal swab. The British carefully peruse the Swedish Supplemental Letter of Request, along with the description of Assange’s alleged offences, but do not seem to grasp the investigative purpose of the Swedish request. They politely write back to the Swedish prosecutor, asking for clarification: ‘It would assist us if you could please send me a line setting out the relevance of this measure to the investigation.’ Marianne Ny gives the only response that is convincing from an investigative perspective: ‘We seek a comparison of the crime stain profiles to find out whether the DNA on the broken condoms is from [Julian Assange]. These pieces of evidence are of importance for the trustworthy [*sic*] of witnesses.’ So, it is purportedly about clarifying the credibility of the two women as witnesses. In her public statements, of course, Marianne Ny never even hinted that the credibility of A. and S. could be in doubt. This would not only have undermined the official narrative of Assange the rapist but would also have been disingenuous, given that this entire narrative had originally been imposed on A. and S. against their wills.

On 30 January 2017, the test results arrive by email from the United Kingdom: the DNA profile found on A.’s bedsheet matches Assange’s profile stored in the British National DNA Database. However, the two DNA profiles found on the two damaged condoms and the one taken from the vaginal swab are not mentioned, implying that none of the three could be successfully matched with Assange’s DNA profile. The wording of the message is final and does not suggest that any further results may be expected. The accompanying official report by the British authorities, dated 2 February 2017, is almost entirely redacted. But the structure of the text shows that four different points or sub-points are being discussed, likely corresponding to the four requested profile checks. Of these four points, only one seems to be illustrated in detail with tables and figures. The annexed search results are also fully redacted but seem to refer to only one of the profiles under examination.

The fact that Assange’s DNA profile was confirmed in a stain which both he and A. had expressly mentioned in police interviews as resulting from their intercourse can hardly be regarded as revelatory. The same would have to be said if the three other profiles, taken from the two condoms and the vaginal swab, also matched that of Assange. The fact that this may not be the case, in turn, raises questions that cannot be resolved without access to the unredacted laboratory results. In any case, based on the available evidence, the endless shadowboxing of the Swedish authorities around DNA profiles and condoms appears to be nothing but a masquerade to cover up the obvious lack of prosecutable evidence for their allegations of sexual misconduct against Assange.

#### Headline: ‘The Interrogation of Assange – Word for Word’

For the time being, Assange is still in Stockholm. He has cancelled his departure, originally planned for 25 August 2010, and voluntarily placed himself at the disposal of the Swedish authorities. On the day Chief Prosecutor Finné closes the case of S., she announces that she will instruct Inspector Gehlin to interview Assange concerning the case of A. The following day, on 26 August, Assange is assigned a public defender of his choice – Leif Silbersky – and a formal interview is scheduled for the coming Monday, 30 August. This is surprisingly late for the first interview of a prominent suspect. After all, the rape allegations against him have been in the press for days and triggered a worldwide media hype. Given that Finné has already formally closed the investigation in the case of S., Assange is only questioned about the case of A. The interview is recorded on tape and conducted by Mats Gehlin in the presence of a second police officer, an interpreter, and Assange’s lawyer, Silbersky. Early on in the interview, Assange expresses concern about the confidentiality of his statements. ‘Before I answer that, shall I assume that this is going to go to *Expressen*?’ he asks. Mats Gehlin hastens to reassure him: ‘From us? I am not going to release anything. And the only ones who are here, that’s we three at this interview, plus a stenographer who will write it out afterwards. And I am the only [*sic*] who has access to the case file. So if it comes out in *Expressen*, you can quarrel with me.’ Three days later, on 2 September, *Expressen*’s headline will proudly proclaim: ‘Here is the Interrogation of Assange – Word for Word’.

It is during this interview that Assange is first formally notified of the allegations against him: ‘During the period from 13 to 14 August 2010, in [A.]’s residence at [xx]-gatan in Stockholm, Assange molested [A.] during an act of copulation – which was begun and conducted under the express condition that a condom would be used – by purposely damaging the condom and continuing the copulation until he ejaculated in her vagina.’

Assange denies this allegation. Although he confirms that he had sexual intercourse with A. several times that evening, always with the same condom, he denies having damaged it and states that he had not even been aware that the condom was damaged. According to Assange, after this first night, he continued to share A.’s bed for a week. During this period there were several sexual encounters, albeit without intercourse. Assange says that it was not until Friday, 20 August, that A. accused him of having removed the condom during their sexual intercourse on the first night. But, so far, she had not accused him of damaging the condom – this was the first time he heard this allegation. Assange remembers that, after their sexual intercourse, A. pointed to a wet spot on the bedsheet and asked, ‘Look at that. Is that you?’ He replied, ‘No, it must be you.’ After that, he had no further thoughts about it, especially since it was not brought up again by A. until the day the women went to the police. At the end of the interview, Assange begins on his own initiative to comment on the case of S. as well, but Gehlin does not appear to be interested and concludes the interview. Assange acknowledges that this second story may no longer be relevant, but states for the record that he is available to be questioned about that case as well. ‘We can always continue if it is needed,’ he says to Gehlin. Now that Assange has denied the allegations made against him, and since no investigative measures could realistically prove those allegations beyond reasonable doubt, the time has come for the Swedish Prosecution Authority to also close the case of A. – due to lack of evidence and based on the presumption of innocence. But things turn out differently.

#### Reopening and Expansion of the Investigation

On Friday, 27 August 2010, Director of Public Prosecution Marianne Ny receives Borgström’s complaint against Chief Prosecutor Finné’s decision to drop the case of S. Ny needs no more than two working days to give Finné the opportunity to reconsider her discontinuation order – which she declines – and then to examine the case file herself and come to the opposite conclusion. On 1 September, she reopens the preliminary investigation in the case of S. and expands the suspicion in the case of A. to include more serious offences. In her decision, she merely states that, based on the case file, there is reason to assume that the crime of rape has been committed in the case of S. and the crimes of sexual harassment and sexual coercion in the case of A. She further finds the available materials to be insufficient and decides that all relevant investigative measures must be carried out before coming to a final conclusion. At the same time, Marianne Ny announces that she herself is taking over the case: she relieves Finné of her responsibility for the matter and assigns another prosecutor to conduct the preliminary investigation on behalf of Ny. In her decision, the director of public prosecution leaves no doubt as to her personal prerogatives: ‘Matters of greater importance – such as orders for coercive measures, etc., and the completion of the preliminary investigation – shall be examined by me.’

Strikingly, however, something very important is missing from Marianne Ny’s decision: she does not issue an arrest warrant against Assange. Chapter 24, Section 1 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure expressly requires that any person suspected on probable cause of an offence punishable by imprisonment of two years or more – such as rape – be placed in detention ‘unless it is clear that detention is not warranted’. Given that her decision of 1 September 2010 did not offer any justification for an exception from the general rule, Ny was legally obliged to issue an arrest warrant against Assange. It was not until 24 November 2010 that the Svea Court of Appeal reduced the categorization of the alleged crime to rape of ‘lesser severity’, for which an arrest warrant is not mandatory.

In her decision of 1 September, however, Ny explicitly suspects Assange of a crime carrying a minimum penalty of two years. Initial interviews of all those involved have already taken place. So, unlike the premature decision taken by Kjellstrand on 20 August, there now is a reasonable basis for an arrest warrant – always presuming that Ny genuinely suspects Assange on probable cause of rape. Besides, the circumstances adduced for the necessity of the first arrest warrant of 20 August – namely, Assange’s foreign nationality and lack of residence in Sweden, as well as the risks of flight and collusion – are just as relevant now as they were ten days earlier. However, just like ten days earlier, the Swedish authorities seem more interested in planting sensational headlines than in actually arresting and interrogating the suspect. Because to do so would force their hand, obliging them to formally charge Assange and expedite a trial, which, almost certainly, would result in a quick acquittal for lack of evidence. Such an outcome does not fit with their agenda. As we will see, the prosecutor prefers to wait for Assange to leave the country, and then to accuse him of trying to evade justice.

On 1 September 2010, Director of Public Prosecution Marianne Ny takes control, reopens the preliminary investigation into the alleged rape of S. and expands the case of A. to include both sexual harassment and sexual coercion. From a procedural point of view, this means that Ny must now examine whether there is sufficient evidence for a formal indictment of Assange. To this end, it is necessary to conduct additional interviews with all involved parties, at least in relation to new or reopened allegations that were not covered in previous interviews. Accordingly, within a few days of Ny’s reopening and extending the investigation, fresh interviews are conducted with both women, on 2 September (S.) and 7 September (A.). Julian Assange, meanwhile, the sole suspect and the person most affected by this investigation, is neither arrested nor interviewed. No one seems to be interested in his version of the story. To former Director of Public Prosecution Sven-Erik Alhem, this is a clear breach of prosecutorial duty: ‘It is also imperative according to the Swedish legal procedure that the accused shall have the opportunity to respond to the accusations at the earliest possible time when he still remembers the intimate details.’

#### Denial of the Right to Be Heard

On 8 September, after Assange had heard nothing from the Swedish authorities for a whole week after Ny’s decision, his new lawyer, Björn Hurtig, telephones the director of public prosecution and requests that his client be given the opportunity to be heard in a formal interview. ‘Not just yet’, Ny replies. She knows, of course, that Assange is not a national of Sweden, that his business in the country is finished and he can be expected to leave at any time. She re-interviews the women, but almost demonstratively declines to schedule an interview with the one person she imperatively needs to question before she can decide on formal charges – at least in the case of S., which was not covered by Assange’s previous interview. As will be seen, what appears completely nonsensical for the purposes of criminal prosecution will prove highly effective for the purposes of political persecution, and fit neatly into the ever-growing puzzle of my own investigation.

Another six days go by without Assange hearing back from the authorities. No arrest warrant, no assigned residence, no obligation to report to the police, not even a ban on travel, although all of these measures are expressly provided for in chapters 24 and 25 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure. On 14 September, Assange’s lawyer Hurtig sends an email to Marianne Ny requesting access to all procedural files as stipulated by the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure, including criminal allegations, interview protocols, witness statements, and any documents from the security police. Hurtig stresses that Assange has urgent business abroad and inquires whether his client is permitted to leave Sweden. As Ny will confirm in writing to the Svea Court of Appeal on 24 November 2010, and as will be explicitly acknowledged in the “Agreed Statement of Facts and Issues” appended to the judgment of the British Supreme Court in 2012, she responds to Hurtig on 15 September that there are no formal obstacles preventing Assange from leaving the country and that, at this point in time, several other investigative measures have to be taken before an interview with Assange becomes necessary. She further explains that Inspector Mats Gehlin has fallen ill, and the first investigative task to be completed after his return will be to conduct interviews with two witnesses. In his expert opinion, former prosecutor Alhem states the obvious: ‘This [Gehlin’s illness] is no excuse for the prosecutor’s failure to interview Mr Assange; others could read the file or her [Ny’s] assistant could direct them on the questions to ask.’

Moreover, in terms of sequencing, an objective, unbiased investigation requires that, if at all possible, both the alleged victims and the suspect be heard prior to other witnesses. This is the only way to identify discrepancies between the respective testimonies of the alleged victims and the suspect before questioning other witnesses with a view to determining the veracity of contradicting accounts. The fact that an experienced prosecutor such as Marianne Ny deliberately delayed the questioning of Assange strongly suggests that she was less interested in establishing the truth than in instrumentalizing the alleged victims and other witnesses in order to support and consolidate her own preconceived narrative.

Chapter 23 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure also provides that, in principle, investigative interviews should be conducted in the presence of a reliable witness and of the suspect’s defence counsel, who ‘may put questions to the person who is being questioned’.

However, in this instance the vast majority of initial witness interviews were conducted over the phone, without tape recordings or verbatim transcripts, and without the presence of a second police officer or other witness. In no case was Assange’s attorney permitted to attend or ask questions. As any professional investigator knows, without these safeguards, interviewing police officers remain free to summarize testimonies in their own words, and leading questions, manipulative rephrasing and unwarranted omissions will go unnoticed. Experience also shows that witnesses who are re-interviewed tend to avoid contradicting any written summaries of their original statements that are presented to them, because they do not want to be perceived as unreliable by the authorities. As countless studies have demonstrated, human memory and perception of reality can be strongly influenced and distorted by a wide variety of factors, including unconscious emotional needs for conformity, security, acceptance, and credibility.

According to her own testimony to the British judiciary, Prosecutor Ny made no attempt to schedule an interview with Assange until 21 September, a full month after the *Expressen* headline and three weeks after her own decision of 1 September. The first attempt for which there is conclusive evidence dates from the following day. On Wednesday, 22 September at 4:06 p.m., Ny sends a text message to Hurtig. ‘Hi. Is it clear whether an interview on Tuesday at 5 pm is feasible?’ The date referred to was Tuesday, 28 September 2010. Hurtig replies at 4:48, ‘No, I have not had any contact with my client since we last spoke. I will continue to try to track him down and get back to you as soon as I reach him. But I will be available on Tuesday.’ Four minutes later, Ny writes, ‘Thanks for letting me know. For the time being we are assuming Tuesday 5pm will work. Grateful for definite reply as soon as possible.’ The following afternoon, on Thursday, 23 September at 5:46 p.m., Ny asks again, ‘Hello! Have you been in contact with your client?’ But Hurtig does not respond until 9:01 a.m. on Monday, 27 September: ‘Hello, just want to let you know that I have not been able to establish contact with my client.’ Ten minutes later, Ny thanks Hurtig for the notice: ‘I’ll get back to you later today on our further plans.’ However, Prosecutor Ny neither gets back to Hurtig nor waits to see whether Assange will turn up for his interview the following day. Instead, she suddenly decides to issue an arrest warrant against him on Monday afternoon at 2:15, purportedly due to a risk of flight and collusion. Less than two hours earlier, Assange booked his flight with Scandinavian Airlines SK2679 at Stockholm Arlanda Airport, which will leave the Swedish capital for Berlin Tegel at 5:25 p.m. the same day.

As a witness in the Swedish-British extradition proceedings at City of Westminster Magistrates’ Court, Hurtig will later conceal his text message correspondence with Prosecutor Ny and claim that she never tried to schedule an interview with Assange before his departure on 27 September. This professional oversight is difficult to comprehend and results in a lot of negative press for Hurtig, as well as earning him a reprimand from the Swedish Bar Association. Over and beyond legitimate criticism, Hurtig’s mistake is later blown out of proportion and inappropriately exploited by the British judge in order to undermine the personal credibility not only of Hurtig himself, but also of the expert witnesses instructed by him, and to deflect from the much more serious failures of the Swedish Prosecution Authority. As will become abundantly clear, Hurtig’s misrepresentation of facts had no significant evidentiary relevance, as it could not have affected the actual scope and gravity of the Swedish prosecutor’s malpractice in any way.

For now, let us just note that the text messages exchanged between Ny and Hurtig from 22 to 27 September do not alter the fact that, despite multiple requests on the part of Assange, Prosecutor Ny did not intend to give him the chance to be heard regarding the alleged rape of S. until 28 September 2010. That was six long weeks after the alleged offence, more than five weeks after the unlawful and extremely damaging leak to *Expressen*, and a full four weeks after the rape investigation had been reopened – a massive delay for which there could be no excuse whatsoever. To put this into the context of domestic legislation, here are the standards of expediency set in Chapter 23 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure: ‘The preliminary investigation shall be conducted as expeditiously as possible. When there is no longer reason for pursuing the investigation, it shall be discontinued.’

As far as Assange personally is concerned, it is thus objectively established: that he reacted to the rape allegations by voluntarily postponing his departure from Sweden by more than a month; that he voluntarily participated in the earliest possible police interview and responded to all questions asked by the police on the case of A.; that he repeatedly took the initiative also to be questioned about the case of S.; and that he had requested – and received – prosecutorial approval for his departure from Sweden almost two weeks in advance. The fact that Assange was difficult to reach during his stay in Sweden has nothing to do with trying to evade justice. Two days after his arrival, in response to pressure exerted by the US government, all of his credit cards had been cancelled, rendering him unable to book a hotel or buy food, and forcing him to depend on the hospitality of acquaintances, to spend the night in their private homes or offices, and to constantly change his location. For the same reason, he often did not have enough credit on his phone to make or receive calls.

There is no evidence that Assange was aware of the interview scheduled for him on 28 September, or that he left Sweden knowing that the prosecutor still wanted to interview him at all. All the available evidence illustrates that Hurtig was unable to contact him, and that he left Sweden because the most recent information he had was that the prosecutor did not wish to schedule an interview with him and that he was free to leave the country. In the light of these indisputable facts, the widespread myth that Assange wanted to evade Swedish justice can safely be discarded as deliberate misinformation.

#### Sweden as a ‘Reliable Partner’ of the United States

Was it by chance that Assange’s interview was scheduled for the exact first day after his departure from Sweden? It seems unlikely. Had Prosecutor Ny really wanted to interview him on that day, she would not have relied on a casual text message exchange with Hurtig but would have served him with a formal summons for Assange, as provided for in Chapter 23, Section 7 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure. After all, this was not about a local pickpocket being questioned by the village sheriff, but a politically explosive case that had triggered worldwide media attention and was affected by strong third-party interests. Moreover, had Prosecutor Ny genuinely intended to interview Assange on 28 September at 5 p.m., she would not have issued an arrest warrant against him more than twenty-four hours before the appointment, but only in the event of a ‘no-show’. Unless, of course, she already knew that he planned to depart on 27 September.

So, let’s try to put all of this into a real-world perspective. WikiLeaks had just published the biggest leak in Western military history and was perceived as a serious threat to national security by the United States and its allies, including Sweden and the United Kingdom. It would be ingenuous to believe that, in August 2010, Julian Assange could have visited Sweden without, at the very least, being constantly kept on the radar of the Swedish security police, Säpo. On 18 August, the state-affiliated Swedish Foreign Policy Institute went on national television to express its concern that the planned establishment of WikiLeaks in the country would strain transatlantic relations between Sweden and the United States. In an interview published on 8 September, the head of the Swedish Military Security Service, John Daniels, went as far as to describe WikiLeaks as a ‘threat to our soldiers’. It also was an open secret that the US Department of Justice, under Attorney General Eric Holder, was already exploring avenues for prosecuting Assange and had asked allied nations to do the same. At that time, the US government was well aware of the planned publication by WikiLeaks of the ‘Iraq War Logs’ and ‘CableGate’ and was bent on stopping Assange in his tracks.

More generally, US diplomatic correspondence classified as ‘secret’ (and later published as part of CableGate) offers conclusive evidence that the Swedish government maintained ‘informal information sharing arrangements’ with US intelligence services which were deliberately concealed both from the country’s parliament and from the wider public. ‘Swedish military and civilian intelligence organizations are strong and reliable partners on a range of key issues’, the US embassy in Stockholm noted on 1 May 2007. ‘Due to domestic political considerations, the extent of this cooperation is not widely known within the Swedish government and it would be useful to acknowledge this cooperation privately, as public mention of the cooperation would open up the government to domestic criticism’ (07STOCKHOLM506_a, § 6). In the following year, on 7 November 2008, the US Embassy referred to ‘Swedish constitutional restrictions on the use of intelligence’ and noted that the Swedish Ministry of Justice team ‘expressed a strong degree of satisfaction with current informal information sharing arrangements with the US … which cover a wide range of law enforcement and anti-terrorism cooperation’ and affirmed their ‘willingness to continue feeding information to the US through existing informal channels’. At the same time, given that ‘this was a particularly sensitive time politically in Sweden for issues involving government surveillance and affecting personal privacy’, the Swedish officials expressed concern that these and ‘other existing informal information sharing arrangements’ could be placed ‘at jeopardy’ if exposed to parliamentary scrutiny and public spotlight (08STOCKHOLM748_a). Quite evidently, in the absence of any sort of individual accountability, even the scandal exposing the unlawful rendition by Säpo of the Egyptian nationals Agiza and Al Zery into the hands of CIA torturers had done nothing to enhance the Swedish government’s sensitivity towards its obligations under the country’s constitution and international human rights law.

To the mind of unsuspecting citizens, the blatant lawlessness of international intelligence cooperation might be deeply disconcerting. To anyone even remotely acquainted with the secretive reality of this ‘parallel universe’, however, none of it comes as a surprise. Given the perceived security threat posed by WikiLeaks, it is virtually guaranteed that Säpo constantly monitored the flight booking system at Stockholm airport for the passenger-name ‘Assange’ and that they immediately informed the Swedish Prosecution Authority of the imminent departure of its most prominent suspect – through ‘informal channels’ and without any form of public scrutiny, of course, just like its transatlantic information exchange with the United States.

Assange, for his part, was under no illusions. The surveillance risk had long since become part of his routine. In order not to give the secret services too much advance notice, he bought his flight ticket, as always, shortly before departure and paid with cash, directly at the airport.

On 27 September 2010, Assange arrives at Arlanda Airport around noon. His preferred flight to Berlin is already fully booked, so he has to switch to a later flight and spend a few hours waiting at the airport – longer than he would have liked, long enough to show up in Säpo’s data monitoring system and give the authorities time to consult and react. The fact that Assange is allowed to leave the country even so is not a sign of incompetence on the part of the Swedish authorities, but another puzzle piece suggesting an entirely different agenda. The plan clearly does not appear to be to arrest and interrogate Assange, but to create and perpetuate the public narrative of a fugitive sex offender all the while denying him an opportunity to defend himself. Although Prosecutor Ny was obliged by law to issue an arrest warrant against Assange as soon as she had reopened the rape investigation on 1 September, she only does so once he appears in the passenger monitoring system a few hours before his departure. She then allows him to leave the country and, thereby, gets him to inadvertently confirm the alleged flight risk by his own action.

Should anyone still doubt that the Swedish authorities were fully aware of Assange’s travel plans, that they consciously refrained from arresting him at the border and even ‘accompanied’ his departure in real time, then these reservations will be dispelled by the evidence surrounding the simultaneous disappearance of Assange’s luggage.

Assange travelled to Berlin on 27 September 2010 to meet with various journalists, in particular Holger Stark and Marcel Rosenbach of *Der Spiegel*, as well as Stefania Maurizi of *L’Espresso*. Maurizi would later succeed, through an unrelenting freedom of information lawsuit, in obtaining the release of important documents clearly demonstrating the collusion between Swedish and British authorities. For now, however, the focus was on establishing new publication partnerships for the major leaks that were to be released later in 2010: the Iraq War Logs and CableGate. The purpose, location, and date of these meetings had already been agreed between 26 July and 25 August via unencrypted email correspondence, which could easily be intercepted. So, this information was almost certainly already known to the authorities. Again, it would be completely unrealistic to think that, in August 2010 and with the impending publication of enormous amounts of secret information, the US intelligence services would not be systematically monitoring any unencrypted email correspondence received by WikiLeaks.

We can therefore safely assume that the Swedish authorities knew exactly how long they would have to procrastinate the interview with Assange in order to provoke his purported ‘escape’ from Sweden, while the intelligence services naturally had every interest in intercepting any documents or hard disks which Assange planned to hand over to journalists in Berlin. On this background it becomes clear that it is no coincidence at all that Assange was allowed to leave Sweden despite the existence of a valid arrest warrant and that his luggage disappeared on the journey. Only a short direct flight connects the two capitals, but after landing in Berlin Assange is the only passenger whose checked bag is nowhere to be found. According to Assange, it contained three encrypted laptops and various hard drives containing sensitive records, including evidence of an unpublished war crime.

Assange’s boarding pass shows that, in Stockholm, he checked one piece of luggage weighing thirteen kilograms. A slip of the baggage receipt, with a bar code and the registration number 0117 SK 847249 SK 2679/27SEP, is attached to the boarding pass. However, this bag never arrives in Berlin. The files on record include a baggage loss report from Berlin Tegel Airport, dated 27 September at 7:45 p.m., as well as the signed statements of numerous witnesses, all of whom confirm the loss of Assange’s luggage. Acciona Airport Services, which provides baggage services in Berlin, contacts the Scandinavian airline SAS, but receives no information. At Assange’s request, the journalist Johannes Wahlström inquires with SAS in Stockholm, without any success. Phone calls are also made to SAS from Berlin. The information is always the same: the computer system shows that Assange checked one piece of luggage at Arlanda airport, and that it never left Stockholm, but disappeared inside the restricted area of the airport, immediately after check-in and even before passing through the X-ray. Mysteriously, the bag cannot be found.

Finally, Wahlström calls Inspector Gehlin and confronts him with the fairly obvious conclusion that the Swedish security police might have something to do with the disappearance of Assange’s bag. If the security police were involved, Gehlin says, he would be aware of it, but he promises to make inquiries. Not surprisingly, Gehlin never gets back to Wahlström or anyone else, and the luggage remains unaccounted for to this day. No confiscation order, no notification and certification of seizure, and no legal remedy – all in clear contradiction to Chapter 27 of the Code of Judicial Procedure – another weighty piece in the puzzle. In an email to Assange’s lawyer Björn Hurtig on 15 November 2010, Prosecutor Ny categorically denies any involvement of Säpo in the case – after all, this investigation relates to sexual offences, not national security offences, she says. That is the official narrative. Just as predictable is the reaction of Säpo itself. In response to a question asked by Swedish Radio on 11 December 2010, Säpo merely says it is following developments but cannot comment on its work in individual cases. ‘As usual’, the radio presenter comments laconically, but fails to dig deeper. The Swedish press appears content to be left in the dark and so does the public. The strategy seems to work, and where there is no accuser, there is no judge.

With Assange’s departure from Sweden, the stage was set for the perfect enactment of a script which, on the day of Assange’s first arrest in London on 7 December 2010, was outlined with terrifying precision in an internal mail correspondence of the US global intelligence consulting firm Stratfor: ‘Pile on. Move him from country to country to face various charges for the next 25 years. But, seize everything he and his family own, to include every person linked to Wiki.’ Indeed, as will become increasingly clear in the course of the next months, during his stay in Sweden Julian Assange’s success story had turned into a story of political persecution. The involved governments had successfully snatched the spotlight directed at them by WikiLeaks, turned it around and pointed it at Assange – at him personally, not at his organization, because that would have been too obvious. From that moment and until today, the authorities, the established media and the general public will devote their attention entirely to the alleged misconduct and purported character flaws of Assange. Forgotten are the war crimes and the corruption of the powerful. Mission accomplished!
