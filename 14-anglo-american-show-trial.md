### Chapter 14: Anglo-American Show Trial

#### The Show Trial Begins

The trial for Assange’s extradition to the United States began on 24 February 2020. The public gallery at Woolwich Crown Court, next to Belmarsh prison, only has space for sixteen observers. To get one of these coveted seats, people started queuing outside the courthouse in the cold and wet February weather before dawn. However, even those lucky, determined and organized enough to end up first in line when the doors finally opened could be arbitrarily denied access without explanation. Thus, on the second day of the trial, WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson was about to enter the public gallery when a court official called out his name and function and informed him that the judge had decided to exclude him from the hearing. It was only when Assange’s family members threatened to leave the courtroom in protest that Hrafnsson was allowed to enter.

Representatives of the press had to observe the trial by video link from an adjoining room. The quality of the transmission was appalling. Throughout the morning of the first day, the legal counsel for the prosecution, James Lewis, was barely audible, and Judge Baraitser could not be heard at all. In the course of the trial, it would become increasingly difficult to escape the impression that the eyes and ears of the public were not welcome in Baraitser’s courtroom. Given the excessively obstructive restrictions imposed on Assange, it almost looked like she would have preferred to exclude the defendant himself from his own court hearing. Like a violent criminal, Assange was locked inside a box made of bulletproof glass that was placed in the back of the courtroom, away from his lawyers. During the hearing, he was not allowed to receive any documents from his lawyers, to pass notes to them, or even to shake their hands through the narrow slit in the glass front.

From inside the glass box, Assange had difficulties hearing what was being said in the courtroom. When he repeatedly signalled the problem to Judge Baraitser, she blamed it on the background noise made by demonstrators outside the building, even though this could be heard only faintly inside the courtroom. When Assange tried to speak, Baraitser cut him off and insisted he could only be heard through his defence counsel. But when his defence counsel asked the judge to allow that Assange sit with his lawyers during the hearing, which would have enabled him to give proper instructions, she refused the request, claiming with a straight face that this would be tantamount to a release from custody, which could only be considered in the framework of a formal bail application. In order to appear in court, Assange was reportedly strip-searched twice, handcuffed a total of eleven times and locked up in five different holding cells – all in a single day. Moreover, the prison management seized all his court documents, including confidential material from his lawyers, thus depriving him of his last means of defence.

When Assange’s defence counsel protested in court that these obstructive conditions severely jeopardized due process, the arbitrariness had become so blatant that even the prosecution counsel, James Lewis, stood up to assert that he wanted Assange to have a fair trial, that he was not convinced a bail application was required to allow Assange to sit with his legal counsel, and that it would be standard practice for the judge to intervene with the prison authorities in order to ensure due process. But Baraitser was not swayed. She insisted that she had no jurisdiction over the prison authorities and refused to allow Assange to leave his glass box. After all, she said in all earnest, he might pose a danger to the public – it was a question of health and safety. Overall, it appeared that, to Judge Baraitser, Assange’s presence was a nuisance at best, and a welcome opportunity to intimidate and humiliate him at worst. Either way, given the political importance of this case, it seems inconceivable that she would have so openly disregarded due process without instruction, consent, or acquiescence from above.

The unfolding travesty of justice later prompted the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute (IBAHRI) to issue an unusually harsh press release: ‘[IBAHRI] condemns the reported mistreatment of Julian Assange during his United States extradition trial in February 2020, and urges the government of the United Kingdom to take action to protect him. … It is deeply shocking that as a mature democracy in which the rule of law and the rights of individuals are preserved, the UK Government has been silent and has taken no action to terminate such gross and disproportionate conduct by Crown officials. As well, we are surprised that the presiding judge has reportedly said and done nothing to rebuke the officials and their superiors for such conduct in the case of an accused whose offence is not one of personal violence. Many countries in the world look to Britain as an example in such matters. On this occasion, the example is shocking and excessive.’ The press release concluded with a reference to my official statement to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva of 28 February 2020, when I had presented my annual report explicitly citing Assange’s years of cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment by the United Kingdom, Sweden, Ecuador and the United States as a concrete example of psychological torture.

During the next four days, the prosecution and the defence delivered their opening arguments. Assange’s barristers submitted various bundles of evidence aiming to disprove the facts alleged by the prosecution and delivered legal arguments both orally and in writing. In essence, their reasoning against Assange’s extradition to the United States can be summarized in four principal arguments.

First, counsel argued that the decision to prosecute Assange was politically motivated, and that seventeen of the eighteen counts of the US indictment concerned espionage, which is the classic textbook example of a political offence. Given that the Anglo-American extradition treaty expressly prohibits extraditions for political offences, Assange could not lawfully be surrendered to the United States. Second, during his asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy, Assange had been systematically surveilled, and notably his confidential conversations with his lawyers were recorded by agents cooperating with US intelligence services. This constituted such a serious abuse of process, that it rendered the entire extradition proceeding irreparably arbitrary. Third, no person could be lawfully extradited to a state when such extradition would have to be regarded as oppressive. If extradited to the United States, there was a real risk that Assange would be exposed to a flagrant denial of justice both at trial and at the sentencing stage, that he could receive a grossly excessive sentence of up to 175 years in prison, and that he would be subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading detention conditions, all of which set an insurmountable bar against his extradition. Fourth, based on the requirement of dual criminality, Assange’s extradition to the United States can be permissible only if the offence for which his extradition is sought is punishable in both the US and the UK. This raised the question of whether the activity Assange is accused of – namely, ‘unauthorized obtaining, receiving and disclosure of National Defense Information’ – can constitute a criminal offence at all, particularly in view of the public interest in having that information disclosed, and of the protection of the freedom of expression under both international and domestic law.

For the prosecution, James Lewis began by focusing strongly on distinguishing Assange’s alleged offences from journalistic work protected by the freedom of expression and stressing that Assange’s prosecution did not create any precedent for the criminalization of mainstream journalism. Lewis emphasized that Assange was not being prosecuted for responsible journalism but for endangering the lives of informants by publishing their unredacted names, for conspiring with Chelsea Manning to attempt computer intrusion and for causing her to unlawfully provide him with national defence information.

According to observers, during this initial segment of his argument, Lewis did not address the judge, but primarily spoke to the media representatives. At one point, he even repeated a sentence, explaining that it was important to make sure the journalists had understood his point. The prosecution had even prepared handouts for the journalists in printed and electronic form, which facilitated cut-and-paste reporting in line with US positions. As Lewis was doubtlessly aware, journalists, too, are human and therefore tend to choose the path of least resistance. Apart from that, the fact that Lewis did not appear to find it necessary to convince the judge of his arguments suggests that the United States was not worried about the position of the British judiciary but was primarily concerned with avoiding negative headlines by reassuring and appeasing the mainstream press. By and large, the established media seemed to take the bait and obediently reported on the superficial ‘he said, she said’ played out in court, rather than decrying the disembowelment of justice and the rule of law occurring right there in front of their eyes. None of WikiLeaks’ former media partners involved in publishing the sensational leaks of 2010 and 2011 had the courage to protest the blatant arbitrariness with which Assange was being hounded and abused for the sins they had committed together with him. Even the venerable BBC, once the mouthpiece of the free world, took the easy way out and made sure to miss the forest for the trees.

Lewis subsequently went to great lengths to demonstrate that, in line with the requirement of ‘dual criminality’, each of the actions taken by Assange would be punishable not only under the US Espionage Act, but also under the British Official Secrets Acts, an equally archaic piece of legislation criminalizing the possession and disclosure of official secrets without giving the accused the right to raise a public interest defence.

The prosecution also tried to deny that, if punishable at all, Assange’s publications could constitute a political offence barred from being grounds for extradition. Lewis offered two rather far-fetched reasons for this conclusion. First, WikiLeaks lacked a political motivation, because the organization did not seek to overthrow the US government or to persuade it to change its policies. Second, Assange was not physically present in the United States when he published the Afghan War Diary, the Iraq War Logs and CableGate.

Both arguments were unconvincing, to say the least. Leaving aside the plainly absurd issue of government overthrow, any interview with Julian Assange would have provided ample evidence for his political motivation as an activist promoting policy change towards achieving peace, truth and transparency. Moreover, from a legal perspective, there is absolutely no reason why the extraterritoriality of Assange’s activities should prevent their characterization as ‘political’, particularly given that the United States claims extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction over the exact same activities. Apparently growing concerned over the weakness of the prosecution’s reasoning, Judge Baraitser at the end of the second day hastened to equip Lewis with an alternative argument, which he gratefully adopted.

According to the judge, while the Anglo-American extradition treaty ratified in 2007 indeed prohibited extraditions for political offences, the British Extradition Act of 2003, based on which the Anglo-American treaty had been concluded, did not. In a fit of judicial acrobatics reminiscent of the British Supreme Court’s decision on the Swedish extradition request in 2012, albeit inverting its contortionist logic, Baraitser then argued that the British courts could not apply the Anglo-American treaty, because it was an international agreement and not part of English domestic law. In deciding on the US extradition request for Assange, the British judiciary could therefore only rely on the British Extradition Act, which did not contain a political offence exclusion.

It was almost surreal: whereas the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the British Extradition Act must necessarily be interpreted in line with the United Kingdom’s international obligations under the EU Framework Decision, and then freely invented an interpretation that was neither required nor proposed by that instrument, Judge Baraitser now found that the same Extradition Act could under no circumstances be interpreted in line with the United Kingdom’s international obligations under the Anglo-American extradition treaty, which expressly prohibits extraditions for political offences. As a matter of juridical logic, both decisions are equally unsustainable and seem to unscrupulously instrumentalize judicial power for the achievement of a desired political outcome.

Accurately understood, the British Extradition Act is simply an ‘enabling’ act, which authorizes the British government to conclude extradition treaties with other states, but – in accordance with the longstanding principle ‘no treaty, no extradition’ – cannot serve as a direct basis for individual extradition requests. While bilateral or multilateral treaties may not be more permissive than the enabling act on which they are based, for example by interpreting the term ‘judicial authority’ more expansively, they can be more restrictive and, for example, contain a ‘political offences’ exclusion.

Therefore, the British Extradition Act clearly restricted the interpretation of the term ‘judicial authority’ in the EU Framework Decision, on which the Swedish request of 2010 was based, while the implementation of the Extradition Act is just as clearly restricted by the ‘political offence’ exclusion in Art. 4 of the Anglo-American treaty, on which the US extradition request is based. In fact, if the Anglo-American treaty could not be applied by the British courts, as asserted by Judge Baraitser, then the US extradition request itself would lack a valid legal basis and would have to be dismissed without further consideration. No treaty, no extradition!

After four days of opening arguments, the evidential hearing was initially adjourned until 18 May 2020. Shortly thereafter, the COVID-19 pandemic hit Europe and required a second adjournment until 7 September 2020.

#### Pandemic and Second Superseding Indictment

In May 2020, only the United States registers more deaths from COVID-19 than the United Kingdom. After many years of government-enforced austerity, the resulting depletion of the British public health care system comes back to bite. Clinics and institutions lack everything: protective gowns, masks, gloves, corona tests. Thousands of patients lose their lives and even healthcare workers are paying the ultimate price. Among the most vulnerable groups, along with the elderly, are those with pre-existing respiratory health conditions. The risk of contracting COVID-19 also increases wherever social distancing rules cannot be observed and adequate medical care is not guaranteed. Thus, shelters, migrant reception centres, and prisons become places of high risk.

On 26 June 2020 – International Torture Victims Day – the ‘Doctors for Assange’ group launch their second public appeal in the medical journal *The Lancet*: ‘Mr Assange is at grave risk from contracting COVID-19. As he is non-violent, being held on remand, and arbitrarily detained according to the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, he meets internationally recommended criteria for prisoner release during COVID-19. A bail application with a plan for monitored home detention was refused, however, and Mr Assange is held in solitary confinement for 23 h each day.’ Stella Moris, Assange’s partner and mother of their two young sons, later confirms that, in case of a temporary release, Assange would have been accommodated with her and their children. But her hopes are dashed. With the onset of the pandemic, the prison goes into lockdown and prohibits all external visits, reducing Assange’s contact with the outside world to short, strictly regulated and monitored phone calls.

The lockdown restrictions also pose a major problem for Assange’s legal team, as the ban on personal visits severely jeopardizes their ability to prepare for the extensive evidential hearing scheduled to begin on 7 September 2020. To make matters worse, without prior notice, the US Department of Justice publishes a second superseding indictment on 24 June 2020. This supersedes the previous superseding indictment of 23 May 2019 which, in turn, had superseded the original indictment of 6 March 2018. While the eighteen counts of May 2019 remain unchanged, the underlying description of facts has once more significantly expanded: from a mere six pages in 2018, to thirty-seven pages in 2019, and now to a total of forty-eight pages. The factual allegations of the 2020 indictment no longer focus primarily on the reception and publication of leaked material and, thus, on genuinely journalistic activities. Instead, they describe in detail Assange’s alleged contacts with certain hacker groups, which he is accused to have incited to steal and deliver classified information.

Strikingly, most of these contacts are alleged to have taken place after 2010 and, therefore, cannot possibly be related to the Manning leaks upon which all eighteen counts of the indictment are based. From a prosecutorial perspective, the inclusion of these allegations only makes sense if the United States intends, at a convenient time in the future, to further expand the charges against Assange. The likely aim would be to add a greater number of computer crimes and related conspiracy and incitement charges that are not protected by press freedom. After a US federal judge dismissed the Democratic Party’s lawsuit against Assange and others over the DNC leaks in July 2019 based on press freedom, it would not be surprising if the government sought to expand its own indictment against Assange to activities lying outside the protective scope of the First Amendment of the US constitution. Moreover, the new hacking allegations probably also aim to appease the press and influence public opinion by portraying Assange as a sleazy ‘hacktivist’ who has nothing in common with a ‘real’ journalist.

One year later, in an interview given to the Icelandic newspaper *Stundin* in June 2021, a key source for these new allegations will retract their veracity. Named ‘Teenager’ in the 2020 indictment, the witness is a diagnosed sociopath with criminal convictions for numerous instances of fraud, forgery, theft and sexual abuse of minors. He admits to having fabricated false allegations against Assange for the 2020 indictment in return for a generalized non-prosecution agreement for himself with the FBI and the US Department of Justice. Revealingly, although the story has been meticulously researched and consolidated with reliable evidence, it is not picked up by any of the mainstream media in the United States, the United Kingdom or Australia.

But for the time being we are still in late June 2020, one year before the ‘Teenager’s’ admission of false testimony. The timing of the submission of the second superseding indictment can only be described as deliberately obstructive. Initially, it is published exclusively on the official website of the US Department of Justice. Although it is an absolutely fundamental legal document for the extradition proceeding, the new indictment is transmitted to the British authorities only a full month later, on 29 July 2020. By then, the evidential hearing is a mere five weeks away and the deadline set for Assange’s defence team to submit evidence for these hearings has passed one week earlier. The United States’ new extradition request that must be drafted based on the new indictment arrives another two weeks later, on 12 August. Finally, on 21 August, the United States transmits an addendum clarifying that, in considering the extradition request, the British court should also take into account the facts newly asserted in the second superseding indictment.

As expected, Assange’s lawyers object and point out that this new and untimely submission deprives them of any fair possibility to adequately prepare for the evidential hearing. When the judge offers to adjourn the case for several months, Assange’s lawyers initially decline, because it would be unfair to keep him in prison for several additional months while his health continues to deteriorate due to the extremely restrictive detention conditions. Instead, they request that new factual allegations submitted by the US government should be excluded from the Court’s deliberations, because the deadline for the completion of the US extradition request had passed more than a year prior to the submission of the new indictment.

But Judge Baraitser seems to have found a more convenient solution. She does not exclude the new factual allegations of the United States as a late submission related to the original extradition request but appears to treat them as the basis for a separate, entirely new extradition request. Accordingly, when the evidential hearing begins on 7 September 2020, she writes off the 2019 extradition warrant, releases Assange and immediately re-arrests him based on the new 2020 extradition warrant. Inexplicably, however, Baraitser nevertheless insists on the procedural deadlines set in relation to the previous extradition request and, therefore, does not allow Assange’s defence lawyers to submit any evidence whatsoever in response to the new factual allegations made in the new US indictment. Faced with the absurd situation of being prevented by the judge herself from fulfilling their function as defence attorneys, Assange’s lawyers now have no other choice but to request the adjournment of the case until January 2021 that had been previously proposed by the judge. To their surprise, however, Baraitser has now changed her mind: no adjournment!

#### The Show Trial Continues

And so the show trial pursues its course. This time, the hearings take place in central London, in the Central Criminal Court known as the Old Bailey, near St Paul’s. Even here, however, Judge Baraitser succeeds in almost completely excluding the public from her courtroom. The social distancing rules of the COVID-19 pandemic now serve as a welcome excuse to admit only five persons into the public gallery. Once admitted, however, social distancing rules no longer apply. All five observers are seated perilously close together in one row of seats, whereas two additional rows of seats remain empty. Three additional seats are reserved for representatives of the Australian diplomatic representation in London – the Australian High Commission. They remain vacant throughout the entire hearing. It seems the Australian diplomats have more important things to do than to follow the fate of their national.

Just as in February in Belmarsh, journalists, NGOs and other observers are asked to follow the proceedings in an adjoining room via video transmission. Just as in February in Belmarsh, the quality of sound and image is appalling. And just as in February in Belmarsh, this is not happening in a technologically backward province of a developing country, but in the heart of the British capital. By now, Judge Baraitser no longer even pretends that she is interested in public scrutiny. On the very first day of the hearing, she unceremoniously revokes the video link access granted to some forty officially registered trial observers from the European Parliament and human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders. According to Baraitser, in this case, such remote access is not ‘in the interest of justice’. Both the European parliamentarians and Amnesty International repeatedly intervene with the judge in the following days, reminding her that independent trial observation is an essential prerequisite of the rule of law. However, Baraitser declines to reconsider. The fact that, in terms of procedural transparency, the British judiciary now officially falls behind Guantánamo, Bahrain and Turkey, where Amnesty International has been admitted to observe trials, does not seem to bother the judge at all.

During the hearing, several dozen defence witnesses are set to testify, both in court and remotely. Unsurprisingly, the video and audio connection of those testifying remotely is disastrous: the video image fails repeatedly; audio files are not played back properly; and the timeline increasingly veers out of control. Despite strong objections from the defence team, Baraitser decides that witness statements that have already been submitted to the court in writing are not to be repeated in the oral hearing. This requires journalists and other observers wishing to understand and publicly report on the relevant evidence to separately research the written submissions beforehand – for most of them, predictably, this is a bridge too far.

Having thus reduced the risk of effective public scrutiny to almost zero, Judge Baraitser now starts moving the goalposts regarding the evidence itself. First, she rules that defence witnesses may be cross-examined by the prosecution at length, while prosecution witnesses who are employed by the US government may not be cross-examined by the defence attorneys at all. Second, in response to a US government request, she obediently declares the famous ‘Collateral Murder’ video and any other evidence detailing US war crimes and torture as inadmissible. Third, while the judge cannot reasonably disallow the testimony of the German-Lebanese torture victim Khaled El-Masri, which the US government has vehemently tried to prevent, his statement is made technically impossible, supposedly by an unfortunate breakdown of the video connection. However, unlike other witnesses who had experienced comparable technical difficulties, El-Masri is not given the opportunity to testify on a later date. Even though it is true that this proceeding is not about prosecuting war crimes, the reality of these crimes and the total impunity granted to the perpetrators and their superiors are important factual circumstances explaining not only Assange’s motivation for their publication, but also the reasons for his relentless persecution by the United States.

Next, Baraitser decides to prevent any personal participation of Assange in the hearing, presumably because his voice and statements might have reminded the few souls left in the courtroom of his humanity and desperation. So, the judge once again keeps him locked away behind bulletproof glass, far from his lawyers. She also reiterates her gag order for Assange, insisting that he may not speak in person, but may only participate in the proceedings through his lawyers. When on one occasion Assange cannot help but exclaim ‘nonsense’ in response to a statement made by the prosecutor, Baraitser immediately threatens to have him removed from the courtroom if he should dare to open his mouth again.

Just as in a dictatorial show trial, the choreography of this proceeding seems predetermined and must be strictly observed. Any human emotion, inconvenient truth, or other unforeseen factor that could alter the outcome must be immediately suppressed. Nevertheless, to those who know him, Assange’s agony and exhaustion are perceptible even through the bulletproof walls of his cage. Each day of the hearing, early in the morning, he is strip-searched, X-rayed, handcuffed and moved to a holding cell before being shipped to court, standing upright in a claustrophobically narrow prison transport van for ninety minutes in each direction.

As a professor of law at a British university, I have been profoundly shocked, in a politically prominent case like this, to see the British judiciary dehumanize the defendant; refuse to admit evidence of central importance to the defence; disregard fundamental principles of due process; and almost completely exclude the public from the courtroom. The fact that this travesty of justice did not prompt the entire defence team to leave the courtroom in protest, that it did not trigger a public outcry in the established media, and that the political leadership seemed to be content with Assange undergoing a show trial more redolent of an authoritarian regime than a mature democracy, shows how far British society has already become desensitized to the formal requirements and practical importance of the rule of law.

#### The Evidential Hearing

In the course of the evidential hearing, which lasted from 7 September to 1 October 2020, it became devastatingly clear why Judge Baraitser had done everything to exclude the public from her courtroom and suppress any form of effective scrutiny by the media, civil society and international observers. Every day, one by one, witness testimonies and expert reports systematically dismantled the legal and factual building blocks of the entire US case against Assange, leaving nothing but the plain proof of a ruthless political persecution.

Much of the factual and legal evidence brought during the hearing has already been discussed elsewhere in this book and will not be repeated here. Nevertheless, to enable full appreciation of the flagrancy with which the rule of law is being violated in this case, it is nevertheless important to provide an overview of the most important topics and how they were addressed in context.

The most decisive issue discussed during the evidential hearing was without doubt Assange’s physical and mental health. Numerous witnesses commented on this question, including Dr Sondra Crosby, who had examined Assange five times, both at the Ecuadorian embassy and at Belmarsh, and whose medical report to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights had contributed decisively to triggering my own involvement in the case. Another important witness was Professor Michael Kopelman, an experienced psychiatrist who had visited Assange a total of nineteen times at Belmarsh and had traced his medical history back to his youth in Australia. Kopelman warned of severe depression; post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); anxiety disorder and traits of autism spectrum disorder (ASD); resulting in acute suicidal tendencies: ‘I am as certain as a psychiatrist ever can be that, in the event of imminent extradition, Mr Assange would indeed find a way to commit suicide.’ Other experts also diagnosed him with depression and Asperger’s. The overall picture was that of a person who, despite remarkable resilience, had suffered massively from years of persecution and isolation, and who was determined to avoid extradition through suicide. In responding for the prosecution, James Lewis tried to downplay concerns over Assange’s state of health and to undermine the credibility of witnesses and evidence. He also repeatedly insinuated that Assange was malingering or exaggerating his symptoms in order to induce a diagnosis that would help him avoid extradition, but was unable to provide any evidence supporting these claims.

Lewis then turned his attention to my own official letter to the British government of 27 May 2019, which he knew could not reasonably be omitted from the record of the hearing. He did so conveniently while cross-examining medical doctors as witnesses for the defence, who were not human rights experts competent to examine the accuracy of my legal findings. Without any explanation as to my mandate and function, Lewis read out several pages of my letter in court, predominantly non-medical passages relating to due process violations and persecutorial collusion between the involved states. In doing so, he made sure to impress on the mind of the witnesses his unreserved indignation at my unflattering observations. Lewis then tried to manipulate the medical experts into agreeing that my legal and factual findings were ‘neither balanced nor accurate’ and not ‘worthy of reliance in any part’. The witnesses realized, of course, that as medical doctors they could not be expected to judge the accuracy of my legal conclusions and prudently limited themselves to concurring with the medical findings of the two doctors who had accompanied my visit to Belmarsh.

When he did not succeed in getting the medical experts to discredit my legal findings, Lewis skilfully tricked them into referring to the non-medical passages of my letter as ‘political’ (rather than ‘legal’), simply by putting the desired word into their mouths. Sensing the danger but missing the fine print, the doctors wisely declined to give a substantive opinion on the ‘political passages’. In reality, of course, official communications transmitted by UN human rights experts are of an exclusively legal, never political, nature, and therefore are directly relevant for the legal determinations to be made in court. By characterizing my findings as ‘political’, the prosecution sought to dismiss their relevance for the legal questions put before the court, and Judge Baraitser gratefully played along. Lewis concluded the matter by summarily dismissing my observations as ‘obvious, palpable nonsense’ – conveniently in my absence, without risking that I might substantiate my unwelcome findings under cross-examination. Judge Baraitser apparently found no fault in Lewis’s manipulative and plainly offensive dismissal of the official findings submitted by a UN Special Rapporteur based on a prison visit and medical examination conducted upon invitation of the British government.

Moving on to a different topic, several experts confirmed that Assange’s fear of disappearing into a US Supermax prison for the rest of his life was by no means irrational. Even the prosecution witnesses acknowledged the real risk that, if extradited to the United States, Assange would be held under Special Administrative Measures (SAMs) both during pre-trial detention and while serving his sentence. In effect, that meant total isolation from any interpersonal contact. Strikingly, the discussion in court on SAMs focused primarily on whether, in view of Assange’s state of health, these conditions of detention should necessarily – or only possibly – have to be considered as ‘oppressive’ and, thus, as violating the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment. The prosecution argued that it could not be predicted with certainty whether Assange would indeed be subjected to SAMs. Moreover, even if SAMs were imposed, they would be periodically reviewed by the attorney general with a view to their possible mitigation or termination. Therefore, should Assange’s extradition be granted, neither the risk of inhuman treatment nor the likelihood of suicide could be reliably predicted. It was a feeble attempt to undermine overwhelming evidence that the detention regime awaiting Assange in the United States was utterly incompatible with the absolute and universal prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

A particularly shocking revelation was the extreme intrusiveness of Assange’s surveillance inside the Ecuadorian embassy, as well as the fact that the Spanish security company UC Global, which had been contracted to guard the embassy, had worked for a US intelligence agency behind the back of its primary client, the Ecuadorian government. As became apparent, UC Global’s cooperation with US intelligence included not only the systematic audio and video surveillance of Assange’s confidential meetings with lawyers, doctors and private visitors, but went much further. Written witness statements by former UC Global employees confirmed, among other things, that plans had been drawn up to leave the embassy doors open so that agents from the outside could enter and kidnap or poison Assange.

While Lewis dismissed these testimonies, too, as ‘completely irrelevant’, their legal significance for the extradition proceeding cannot be overstated. Apart from the obvious criminality of any plan to kidnap or murder Assange, his secret surveillance at the behest of the US government constitutes such a grave violation of due process principles, attorney–client confidentiality, doctor–patient confidentiality, and personal privacy that the entire case affected by it, including both the US prosecution and the related extradition request, can only be dismissed as irreparably arbitrary.

A central argument of Assange’s defence team against his extradition and prosecution for his publishing activities remained his right to freedom of expression and freedom of the press. Trevor Timm, defence witness and executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, pointed to the Watergate scandal. At the time, in the early 1970s, the corruption within the Nixon administration was only exposed because investigative journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of the *Washington Post* could pursue their work without fearing that their revelations would be prosecuted as espionage. Another witness, the attorney and activist Carey Shenkman, emphasized the frequency with which classified material is being deliberately leaked by US government agencies themselves in order to influence public opinion. Needless to say, none of these leaks have ever resulted in criminal prosecution.

Even Daniel Ellsberg, by now almost ninety years old, gave testimony. Famously charged with espionage for blowing the whistle in the 1971 Pentagon Papers case, Ellsberg insisted that the WikiLeaks publications were protected under the First Amendment of the US Constitution. This followed from the US Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in the Pentagon Papers case, which had reaffirmed and strengthened press freedom and the public’s right to know. As a matter of logic, if Assange could be charged with espionage for publishing classified documents, then the same had to apply to WikiLeaks’ media partners, first and foremost the *New York Times*, the *Guardian*, *Der Spiegel*, *El País* and *Le Monde*. But this would be a frontal attack on press freedom and the precedent set by the Supreme Court in 1971. This dilemma, the so-called ‘*New York Times* problem’, was what had persuaded the Obama administration not to prosecute Assange.

Addressing the related allegations that Assange had ‘conspired’ with Chelsea Manning to violate her duty of non-disclosure, numerous defence witnesses confirmed that it is part and parcel of any investigative journalist’s daily routine to solicit sources and encourage them to share evidence, even if the information is classified as secret. Journalists also have a duty to take active source protection measures that make the identification of whistleblowers more difficult or even impossible. Adopting the same position as US federal judge Koeltl in his 2019 dismissal of the DNC lawsuit against Assange and others, they argue that the line towards criminality is only crossed once journalists themselves participate in the act of data theft, for example by illegally penetrating a protected computer system in order to obtain secret information. But that is not what Assange is accused of. His source, Chelsea Manning, already had full access to all the leaked information. Instead, Assange was alleged to have tried – unsuccessfully – to help Manning crack a password hash that would have allowed her to log into the same system under a different identity and, thus, to cover her tracks within that system. This was a typical source protection measure and could not be regarded as aiding and abetting, or incitement, of a computer crime. There was therefore no legal or factual basis for the US conspiracy charges brought against Assange.

Importantly, it was made clear that the right to freedom of opinion and expression is not restricted to journalists, but applies to anyone, so that the eternal discussion as to whether or not Assange can be regarded as a ‘proper’ journalist has never had any real legal relevance. Juridically unsustainable, too, is the argument made by the Trump administration that Assange, having acted as a foreigner abroad, is not entitled to constitutional freedom of expression protections, but that he can nevertheless be prosecuted under the US Espionage Act for the same conduct. If nothing else, this demonstrates that, in the event of his extradition to the United States, Assange would not be guaranteed effective human rights protection.

Numerous witnesses also refuted allegations that Assange had knowingly endangered human lives by publishing the unredacted names of local informants and collaborators of the United States, thereby exposing them to acts of revenge. Although, to this day, the US government has not succeeded in producing any reliable evidence to that effect, the ‘put-lives-at-risk’ narrative is one of the oldest, most die-hard myths surrounding the WikiLeaks publications. Already at the trial of Chelsea Manning in 2013, the US Department of Defense explicitly acknowledged that it had ‘no concrete example’ of any individual having suffered harm or being exposed to a serious threat as a consequence of the WikiLeaks publications. Seven years on, at the evidential hearing in London in September 2020, nothing had changed.

On the other hand, numerous journalists and other witnesses expressly confirmed that Assange had handled sensitive data responsibly. For example, John Sloboda of the Iraq Body Count project and former *Der Spiegel* journalist John Goetz had both been involved in the publication of the Iraq War Logs in 2010. Now they recalled the irritation of WikiLeaks’ established media partners when Assange insisted that Iraqi names be filtered out of the documents and redacted before publication. Australian journalist Nicky Hager then formally made the point that it was not Assange, but two *Guardian* journalists, who had first made the unredacted CableGate documents accessible to the public.

The story is well known. In their book, *WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange’s War on Secrecy*, published in February 2011, Luke Harding and David Leigh of the *Guardian* revealed the password that Assange had confidentially shared with his media partners enabling them to access and work on the unredacted material which had been stored in a single backup file at various locations on the internet. Another journalist, at the German weekly *Der Freitag*, had detected the location of the file and, with the password published by Leigh and Harding, was able to access and download a full copy of the original unredacted material. Instead of keeping this information confidential, *Der Freitag* published the scoop in late August 2011, providing sufficient information to make the unredacted CableGate file accessible to any interested party. *Der Freitag*’s editor-in-chief Jakob Augstein, also a defence witness, confirmed that Assange had personally urged them not to go public with this information and had expressed concern that individuals named in the unredacted documents might be exposed to harm. A full audio recording of a phone conversation between Assange and his contacts at the US State Department, which circulates on the internet, proves that Assange immediately informed the US government of the security leak and recommended urgent harm reduction measures for the protection of individuals that might be put at risk – a far cry from the image of the reckless narcissist ‘with blood on his hands’ that has been fed to the public.

The objective chronology of the unredacted CableGate publication was scientifically reconstructed by expert witness Christian Grothoff, professor of computer science in Switzerland. His meticulous report provides irrefutable technical evidence that Assange had published the original unredacted material only after it had already been made publicly available, against his will, by Leigh and Harding, in conjunction with *Der Freitag*. This demonstrated that WikiLeaks was not the original publisher, but only the re-publisher of the unredacted CableGate file, and that the responsibility for any harm or threat resulting from its unredacted publication could not be attributed to Assange. The fact that neither the two *Guardian* journalists nor *Der Freitag* were ever held accountable for their conduct is a clear indication that the ‘put-lives-at-risk’ narrative was deliberately misused as just another tool to demonize Assange, and to divert attention from the inconvenient content of the leaked documents.

#### The Screaming Silence of the Press

The strong support and solidarity that Assange has received from journalists testifying in court stands in stark contrast to the pervasive media silence outside the courtroom. By media silence I do not mean to say that nothing has been reported about Assange and his case, but that what has been reported has been largely irrelevant or missing the point.

Interestingly, the German language press became the first mainstream media to have a change of heart. Starting in 2019, papers such as the *Süddeutsche Zeitung* as well as the Swiss *Wochenzeitung* and *Sonntagsblick* prepared the ground. On 31 January 2020 my interview with the Swiss online paper *Republik* appeared – a first important breakthrough. Just in time for the beginning of Assange’s extradition hearing three weeks later, it shocked with a concise summary of my investigative conclusions and with a few pieces of leaked correspondence illustrating the deliberate abuse of process against Assange. Supported by the relentless advocacy of countless activists, personalities, and organizations, a slow but steady change in public opinion was set in motion and kept gaining momentum.

German public broadcasters now reported not only on the latest developments in the extradition hearings, but increasingly also featured critical interviews, investigative documentaries, and in-depth analysis. In contrast to the gleeful malice which permeated media commentary following Assange’s arrest in April 2019, journalists now started to express genuine concern about the implications of this case for press freedom and the rule of law. Thus, in September 2020, the *Süddeutsche Zeitung* wrote: ‘In London, the United States’ war on whistleblowers and their supporters is about to reach its climax so far. A war which will re-examine the limits of press freedom. This case will determine, among other things, what journalists will still be able to publish in the future – without fear of being prosecuted in the United States.’ Slowly but surely, journalists began to understand that the trial of Julian Assange was not as much about Assange as it is about them. At Number 10 Downing Street, the organization Reporters Without Borders attempted to hand over a petition with 80,000 signatures, calling on the British government not to extradite Assange – but the authorities refused to receive the petition.

The established press in the US, UK and Australia, on the other hand, still does not seem to have understood the existential danger posed by the trial of Julian Assange to press freedom, due process, democracy and the rule of law. The painful truth is that, if only the main media organizations of the Anglosphere so decided, Assange’s persecution could be ended tomorrow. The case of Ivan Golunov, a Russian investigative journalist specialized in exposing official corruption, may serve as a textbook example. When Golunov was suddenly arrested for alleged drug offences in the summer of 2019, the Russian mainstream press immediately saw through the game. ‘We are Ivan Golunov’ read the identical front pages of Russia’s three leading dailies, *Vedomosti*, *RBC* and *Kommersant*. All three papers openly questioned the legality of Golunov’s arrest, suspected that he was being persecuted for his journalistic activities, and demanded a thorough investigation. Caught in the act and exposed by the spotlight of their own mass media, the Russian authorities back-pedalled a few days later. President Putin made a point of personally ordering Golunov’s release and dismissing two high-ranking Interior Ministry officials. If nothing else, this proved that Golunov’s arrest had not been the result of misconduct on the part of a few incompetent police officers but had been orchestrated at the highest level.

Without a doubt, a comparable joint action of solidarity by the *Guardian*, the BBC, the *New York Times* and the *Washington Post* would put an immediate end to the persecution of Julian Assange. For if there is one thing governments fear, it is the unforgiving spotlight of the mass media and their critical scrutiny. But what is happening in the British, American and Australian mainstream media is simply too little, too late. As ever, their reporting continues to oscillate between tame and lame, obediently journaling the daily events in court without even grasping that what they are witnessing are the side effects of a monumental societal regression from the achievements of democracy and the rule of law back into the dark ages of absolutism and the ‘*arcana imperii*’ – a governance system based on secrecy and authoritarianism. A handful of half-hearted opinion pieces in the *Guardian* and the *New York Times* rejecting Assange’s extradition are not bold enough, and so fail to convince. While both papers have timidly declared that convicting Assange of espionage would endanger press freedom, not a single mainstream media outlet protests the blatant violations of due process, human dignity and the rule of law that pervade the entire trial. None holds the involved governments to account for their crimes and corruption; none has the courage to confront political leaders with uncomfortable questions; none feels dutybound to inform and empower the people – a mere shadow of what was once the ‘fourth estate’.

#### My Last Appeals

In the weeks that followed until the end of November 2020, the prosecution and defence submitted their written closing statements. Assange remained isolated in Belmarsh prison. The seventh of December 2020 marked the tenth anniversary of Assange’s first arrest by British police. On that day, I sent an urgent appeal to the British government, which was published the next morning: ‘UN expert calls for immediate release of Assange after 10 years of arbitrary detention’. In the meantime, the COVID-19 pandemic had broken out at Belmarsh. For Assange, this posed an acute threat, as he suffered from a chronic respiratory disease and his resistance had been weakened for years. ‘Mr Assange is not a criminal convict and poses no threat to anyone, so his prolonged solitary confinement in a high security prison is neither necessary nor proportionate and clearly lacks any legal basis’, I wrote, clarifying that this detention regime, in view of its long duration, also violates the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment. I therefore called on the British government to immediately release Assange or place him under guarded house arrest, where he could lead a normal family, social, and professional life, recover his health, and prepare his defence in the US extradition proceedings. I concluded with an urgent appeal to the British authorities not to extradite Assange to the US under any circumstances, due to serious human rights concerns. Once more, the British government did not find it necessary or appropriate to respond.

By contrast, a group of fifteen members of the British Parliament, led by Richard Burgon and Jeremy Corbyn, granted me an online hearing on the Assange case on the evening of 8 December 2020. Based on my conclusions that Assange’s human rights were being violated by the British authorities, the law-makers sent a concerned letter to Secretary of State for Justice Robert Buckland on 16 December, requesting ‘that provision be made to hold an online video discussion between Julian Assange and a cross-party group of UK parliamentarians’ before the judicial decision on his extradition was made. The declared purpose of the meeting was to discuss with him his treatment and the wider implications of his case. But, once again, the executive branch demonstrated its disdain for Parliament. Six months later, in June 2021, Burgon wrote another letter to the governor of Belmarsh and Secretary Buckland, expressing strong frustration at ‘the ongoing refusal of you and the Justice Secretary to allow an online video meeting between Julian Assange and a cross-party group of British parliamentarians … It is simply unacceptable that six months on this simple request continues to be met with such intransigence. You have the authority to grant such a meeting and we call on you to facilitate an online meeting without further delay.’

But, for now, we are still in December 2020, and Judge Baraitser has announced her decision on Assange’s extradition to the United States for 4 January 2021. I assume that the date was set so late in order to allow British authorities to wait for the outcome of the US presidential election on 3 November 2020, and then tailor the extradition decision to the wishes of the winner. I was under no illusions about the prevailing power-political context. After all, following the completion of Brexit – the British exit from the European Union – by the end of the year, the United Kingdom would become completely dependent on its ‘special relationship’ with the United States and could not afford any disagreements on any issue of foreign policy. As noted by Alan Duncan, then British minister of state for Europe and the Americas, on 8 April 2019, three days before Assange’s arrest: ‘Everything we believe in is ultimately subordinated to our not wanting to clash with the US.’ Accordingly, with the victory of Joe Biden over Donald Trump, the British government needed time to find out what Biden’s position would be on the extradition of Assange after his inauguration on 20 January 2021.

But first, with the impending departure of Donald Trump, another possibility came into play: the presidential pardon. The US Constitution gives the president the power to grant a federal ‘pardon’ to defendants or convicts, or to shorten or commute a sentence, whether threatened or imposed. This prerogative can be exercised throughout the term of office, but pardons are traditionally concentrated in the last weeks of the presidency. Beginning in late November 2020, many celebrities began to speak out publicly, urging President Trump to pardon Assange, and I decided to make my own appeal as well. I thought it was worth a try, and at the same time it would allow me to reach out to the broader American public with a message that challenged the prevailing narrative about Assange. I wrote my open letter to President Trump on 21 December 2020, two years to the day after my own subconscious bias had led me to decline co-signing an appeal for the release of Assange together with my UN colleagues. Ironically, this time it was the other mandate holders who declined to co-sign. All of them. And so I was the only one to sign the following appeal to President Trump:

> Mr. President,
>
> Today, I respectfully request that you pardon Mr. Julian Assange. Mr. Assange has been arbitrarily deprived of his liberty for the past ten years. This is a high price to pay for the courage to publish true information about government misconduct throughout the world. I visited Mr. Assange in Belmarsh High Security Prison in London, with two independent medical doctors, and I can attest to the fact that his health has seriously deteriorated, to the point where his life is now in danger. Critically, Mr. Assange suffers from a documented respiratory condition which renders him extremely vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic that has recently broken out in the prison where he is being held.
>
> I ask you to pardon Mr. Assange, because he is not, and has never been, an enemy of the American people. His organization, WikiLeaks, fights secrecy and corruption throughout the world, and, therefore, acts in the public interest both of the American people and of humanity as a whole. I ask because Mr. Assange has never published false information. The cause for any reputational harm that may have resulted from his publications is not to be found in any misconduct on his part, but in the very misconduct which he exposed. I ask because Mr. Assange has not hacked or stolen any of the information he published. He has obtained it from authentic documents and sources in the same way as any other serious and independent investigative journalists conduct their work. While we may personally agree or disagree with their publications, they clearly cannot be regarded as crimes. I ask because prosecuting Mr. Assange for publishing true information about serious official misconduct, whether in America or elsewhere, would amount to ‘shooting the messenger’ rather than correcting the problem he exposed. This would be incompatible with the core values of justice, rule of law and press freedom, as reflected in the American Constitution and international human rights instruments ratified by the United States. I ask because you have vowed, Mr. President, to pursue an agenda of fighting government corruption and misconduct; and because allowing the prosecution of Mr. Assange to continue would mean that, under your legacy, telling the truth about such corruption and misconduct has become a crime.
>
> In pardoning Mr. Assange, Mr. President, you would send a clear message of justice, truth and humanity to the American people and to the world. You would rehabilitate a courageous man who has suffered injustice, persecution and humiliation for more than a decade, simply for telling the truth. Last but not least, you would give back to Mr. Assange’s two young sons the loving father they need and look up to. You would also reassure these children, and through them all children of the world, that there is nothing wrong with telling the truth, but that it is the right thing to do; that it is honourable to fight for justice and, indeed, that these are the values America and the world stand for.
>
> For these reasons, I respectfully appeal to you to pardon Julian Assange. Whatever our personal views and sympathies may be, I believe that, after a decade of persecution, this man’s unjust suffering must end now. Please, use your power of pardon to right the wrongs inflicted on Julian Assange, to end his unjust ordeal and reunite him with his family! I respectfully thank you for considering this appeal with foresight, generosity and compassion.

And finally, on Sunday, 3 January 2021, the eve of the first instance verdict in the Anglo-American extradition trial, I published a short personal appeal to Judge Vanessa Baraitser, this time on Twitter for lack of official channels:

> Tomorrow you will render verdict on the extradition of Julian Assange. Today, from lawyer to lawyer, I would like to share with you a quote by the late Thomas Franck, which has inspired and guided me throughout my career as a legal professional. May Lady Justice be with you!
>
> ‘What, then, is the proper role for the lawyer? Surely, it is to stand tall for the rule of law. What this entails is self-evident. When the policy makers believe it to society’s immediate benefit to skirt the law, the lawyer must speak of the longer-term costs. When the politicians seek to bend the law, the lawyers must insist that they have broken it. When a faction tries to use power to subvert the rule of law, the lawyer must defend it even at some risk to personal advancement and safety. When the powerful are tempted to discard the law, the lawyer must ask whether someday, if our omnipotence wanes, we may not need the law. Lawyers who do that may even be called traitors. But those who do not are traitors to their calling.’

#### Setting the Precedent: The Verdict of 4 January 2021

Finally, the day had come. It was 4 January, the first Monday of 2021. In Britain, the new year had started with alarming statistics on the COVID-19 pandemic: record numbers of new infections and unprecedented numbers of deaths. Nevertheless, once again outside the Old Bailey Assange’s supporters had gathered long before sunrise to await the verdict in his extradition trial. Once again, the public was de facto excluded from the courtroom. Only a few observers had been granted access to an adjoining room from where they could follow the hearing through video link and keep the outside world informed through social media. Once again, they complained about poor audio quality. The problem was well known by now, and the authorities clearly had no intention to have it resolved.

Despite these difficulties, fragmentary messages kept trickling through, a new element every few minutes, and over the course of an hour coalesced into the usual picture of unconditional British compliance with US government interests. Step by step, even the most aberrant arguments advanced by the prosecution were unreservedly upheld. At the same time, almost as if in passing, Judge Baraitser dismissed even the most legitimate legal objections and even the strongest exculpatory evidence raised by the defence team.

The indictment and extradition request initiated by the United States: not politically motivated. The prohibition of extradition for political offences in Article 4 of the Anglo-American extradition treaty: not applicable. The surveillance of Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy and the wiretapping of his confidential conversations with medical doctors and lawyers: not objectionable. The impact of the threat of extradition on Assange’s partner and their two children: nothing unusual. The trial awaiting him at the Espionage Court in Virginia: fair. The jury that would decide on his guilt or innocence: unbiased. Assange himself: a threat to US national security. Assange’s publication of evidence for war crimes, torture and corruption: not protected by press freedom. Instead, according to Baraitser, Assange had actively assisted Chelsea Manning in obtaining classified documents, thereby well overstepping the bounds of investigative journalism. Moreover, he had endangered people because their names had not been redacted prior to publication. Therefore, Assange should not be considered a journalist, but simply a data thief and hacker. Finally, Assange’s conduct was punishable not only under the US Espionage Act, but also under the British Official Secrets Act, thus meeting the extradition requirement of dual criminality. The judge completely ignored the fact that, in the course of the evidential hearing, every single allegation on which she based her argument had been proved unsustainable.

The Twitter posts from the observers were sounding increasingly fatalistic. A text message sent to me by one of Assange’s lawyers summed things up: ‘It’s bad.’ I had already given up hope and begun to focus on other things when suddenly a sentence leaped out at me from my computer screen, as if written all in caps: ‘OH MY GOD.’ Over the next few minutes, media posts and messages rushed by, snippets of words complemented and contradicted each other, nothing seemed to make any sense. I hastily clicked from one Twitter feed to another, eventually running five separate feeds across my screen at once, until finally there was clarity: ‘Extradition denied!’

I couldn’t believe my eyes. What had happened? For a few moments, there was complete silence. It was as if a meteorite had struck. Then cheers broke out outside the courthouse, the first explanations started to circulate, and soon the written verdict was published. Judge Baraitser had rejected the US extradition request on medical grounds. Based on the evidence provided by psychiatric experts on Assange’s mental health, and by other expert witnesses on the reality of US detention conditions under Special Administrative Measures, Baraitser found that it would be oppressive to extradite Assange to the United States. ‘It is my judgment that there is a real risk that he will be kept in the near isolated conditions imposed by the harshest SAMs regime, both pre-trial and post-trial. … Mr Assange undoubtedly has the determination, planning and intelligence to circumvent … suicide preventative measures. … I am satisfied that, in these harsh conditions, Mr Assange’s mental health would deteriorate causing him to commit suicide with the “single-minded determination” of his autism spectrum disorder. I find that the mental condition of Mr Assange is such that it would be oppressive to extradite him to the United States of America.’

I immediately had a flashback to a moment during my conversation with Assange, when he told me about the razor blade that had been found in his cell two days earlier, and made it unequivocally clear that he would not be extradited to the United States alive. This determination gave a very real and immediate meaning to Assange’s departing appeal to me – ‘Please, save my life!’ However, I had never spoken about this publicly until Assange’s lawyers decided to openly address his suicide risk during the evidential hearing in September 2020. In a way, the possibility of ending his own life was Assange’s last resort to retain a modicum of control over his own destiny and to escape his utter dehumanization in US Supermax detention. I respected his human dignity too much to undermine this last refuge of his by exposing his plans.

With her verdict, the judge had confirmed my own findings in two respects. First, she acknowledged Assange’s deplorable state of health, which we had diagnosed already during our visit to Belmarsh eighteen months earlier, and which had further deteriorated due to the constant exposure to arbitrariness and isolation. What Baraitser did not say, however, was that Assange’s frailty was by no means his natural constitution, but a direct consequence of ten years of relentless persecution and mistreatment by Sweden, the United Kingdom, Ecuador and the United States. Second, the judge also confirmed the inherent inhumanity of the detention conditions likely to be imposed on Assange in a Supermax prison. In this context, Baraitser explicitly spoke of ‘near total isolation’, ‘cages’, and ‘extreme conditions’. In doing so, the judge also acknowledged, at least implicitly, that Assange’s permanent fear of extradition to the United States, his asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy, and his refusal to travel to Sweden without a non-refoulement guarantee, had been legally justified, and that he had been wrongly convicted and sentenced for bail violation.

From the perspective of my UN mandate, this was, of course, an accurate and welcome assessment. Nevertheless, I was under no illusions: the US, Britain, Sweden and Ecuador had not spent a decade and millions of dollars persecuting, defaming and spying on Assange, only to now set him free on humanitarian grounds. I therefore feared that, in truth, Baraitser’s denial of extradition was not a victory of the rule of law, humanity, or even justice, but rather a brilliantly conceived trap.

The primary purpose of persecuting Assange is not – and never has been – to punish him personally, but to establish a generic precedent with a global deterrent effect on other journalists, publicists and activists. This purpose Judge Baraitser had achieved with terrifying effectiveness. Her ruling not only confirmed the entire legal rationale of the United States, which ultimately amounts to criminalizing investigative national security journalism as espionage; but it also expressly extended the scope of this rationale to the British Official Secrets Act, a piece of legislation which has served as a model for secrecy laws in many countries of the British Commonwealth. Thus, Judge Baraitser laid the legal foundation for the prosecution of anyone, anywhere in the world, who dared to expose the dirty secrets of the governments concerned, and for depriving defendants of the right to justify their action based on public interest. In effect, she had set a legal precedent introducing an absolute duty of silence on classified evidence for state-sponsored crimes – a global *lex omertà*.

In doing so, Judge Baraitser had fulfilled the entire wish list of the US government. Had she also allowed the extradition to go ahead, this certainly would have triggered an appeal by Assange, challenging the permissibility of her legal precedent before the British High Court. At the High Court, the case would be examined by a more experienced and authoritative panel of judges, whose decision would be difficult to predict. In order to avoid a full legal review of her judgment by the High Court, Judge Baraitser had to forestall an appeal by Assange’s legal team. If the main rationale of the first instance ruling remained unchallenged, the desired legal precedent would be created ‘under the radar’ of the higher levels of the judiciary, of the public and of the independent press – a precedent whereby troublesome journalists could be prosecuted and silenced worldwide and press freedom would be de facto abolished.

By refusing to extradite Assange, Judge Baraitser conveniently put the ball into the court of the United States. This means that it would be up to the US government, and not Assange, to lodge an appeal and, therefore, to select the legal questions that would be reviewed by the High Court. Predictably, the US appeal would challenge only those aspects of Baraitser’s ruling with which the US government disagreed, in particular the finding that, if extradited to the United States, Assange was at real risk of exposure to inhumane detention conditions and would almost certainly find a way to commit suicide. These were factors which the United States could easily address without endangering the desired legal precedent of criminalizing investigative national security journalism. In fact, all the US needed to do was to provide the High Court with diplomatic assurances that Assange would not be subjected to SAMs or other forms of inhumane treatment and that his suicide could be effectively prevented in US custody. Based on such assurances, the appeal judges could potentially conclude that Assange’s extradition would no longer be oppressive and permit his surrender to the United States.

In this scenario, the British High Court would not have to examine any of Assange’s legal objections regarding the political nature of the prosecution, the prohibition of extraditions for political offences, freedom of speech, or the systematic abuse of process throughout this case. All these objections had been rejected in Baraitser’s ruling and would not be revisited by the High Court as long as her judgment remained unchallenged in this respect. Thus, the only way to prevent Assange’s fast-track extradition based on US diplomatic assurances was for Assange’s lawyers to lodge a cross-appeal against Baraitser’s ruling as far as those issues were concerned. But that would require frequent and extensive preparatory meetings with Assange, rendered practically impossible by his arbitrary isolation at Belmarsh.

Not surprisingly, Baraitser’s verdict did not cause undue distress on the other side of the Atlantic. Without missing a beat, and perhaps rather too smoothly, the US Department of Justice declared that ‘While we are extremely disappointed in the court’s ultimate decision, we are gratified that the United States prevailed on every point of law raised. In particular, the court rejected all of Mr. Assange’s arguments regarding political motivation, political offence, fair trial, and freedom of speech. We will continue to seek Mr. Assange’s extradition to the United States.’ Indeed, on that day the US government had come a big step closer to criminalizing inconvenient journalism. At the same time, ideal conditions had been created for Assange’s non-extradition to be overturned on appeal.

Baraitser’s ruling of 4 January concluded with the words: ‘I order the discharge of Julian Paul Assange’. The judge was fully aware, of course, that her order would not be executed but would be appealed by the US government. Two days later, she rejected Assange’s release on bail on grounds of flight risk during the appeals proceedings. The fact that the very same purpose – flight prevention – could have been achieved through guarded house arrest demonstrates that Assange’s continued incarceration in Belmarsh has nothing to do with flight risk, but everything with wanting to keep him silenced and under pressure.

As long as Assange remains isolated in prison, neither the United States nor the United Kingdom will be in a hurry to bring the extradition proceeding to a conclusion. The longer every procedural step can be spun out, the more Assange’s health and stability will deteriorate, and the stronger the deterrent effect on other journalists and whistleblowers will be. As the authorities know very well, it is only a matter of time before Assange’s resilience breaks. If he should die in prison, or if his mental health should deteriorate to the point where he can be stripped of his legal capacity and locked away in a closed psychiatric institution for the rest of his life, then the case could be closed without fear of the judicial precedent of 4 January 2021 being overturned by a panel of conscientious judges at the higher British courts, the European Court of Human Rights or, ultimately, the US Supreme Court. Should Assange have the strength to withstand the pressure of his isolation until the end of the extradition proceedings, on the other hand, his resilience will no doubt be used against him as purported evidence disproving his medical frailty and suicide risk. Once the judiciary has been instrumentalized for political purposes, there is no escape.

#### Playing Out the Plot: US Appeal to the High Court of Justice

Tellingly, although the US government had transmitted its provisional grounds for appeal to the British High Court of Justice as early as 15 January 2021, followed by a perfected version on 11 February, it would take a full six months after Baraitser’s ruling just for the High Court to decide on the next procedural step. This was extremely slow, particularly given that, during that whole period, Assange remained incarcerated under needlessly restrictive conditions for purely preventative purposes.

By an order signed on 5 July 2021, High Court Justice Jonathan Swift finally granted the United States permission to appeal the ruling on three out of five grounds. Most importantly, Justice Swift rejected any effort of the US government to second-guess District Judge Baraitser’s conclusions on the validity and weight of medical and expert evidence brought by the parties during the extradition hearing, in particular concerning the assessment of Assange’s mental health and the resulting risk of suicide. On these points of fact, Judge Baraitser’s evidential findings were found to fall within the bounds of reasonableness, which makes them difficult for the US to challenge.

Crucially, however, Justice Swift decided that the High Court would hear the appeal on the three remaining grounds. First, in the view of the United States, Judge Baraitser had not correctly applied the legal criteria set out in the 2003 Extradition Act for determining whether it would be oppressive to extradite Assange on grounds of his mental condition. Most notably, according to the US government, Baraitser had not sufficiently evaluated the measures in place in US prisons for the prevention of suicide, but had simply jumped to the conclusion that Assange was sufficiently determined and intelligent to circumvent any such measures regardless. Second, Judge Baraitser should have afforded the United States the opportunity to provide ‘undertakings’ – that is, diplomatic assurances – that would have alleviated her concerns about Assange being subjected to excessively harsh detention conditions and, in particular, to SAMs.

Thirdly, and accordingly, the United States provided the United Kingdom with what it described as ‘a package of assurances which are specifically responsive to the findings made by the District Judge’ and which ‘deal comprehensively with the conditions of detention which the District Judge found would precipitate Mr Assange becoming suicidal’. In particular, the United States guaranteed that Assange would not be subject to SAMs or imprisoned at the infamous ADX Supermax facility in Florence, Colorado, unless he were to do something subsequent to the offering of these assurances that would justify such measures or designation. Moreover, the United States guaranteed that Assange would ‘receive any such clinical and psychological treatment as is recommended by a qualified treating clinician employed or retained by the prison where he is held in custody’. Last but not least, the United States also assured that Assange would be allowed to serve any US-imposed prison sentence in his native Australia.

None of this came as a surprise to me, and none of it came as a relief. As always when governments give diplomatic assurances, these undertakings look decent on paper but play out completely differently in practice. While the US government may have excluded the application of SAMs to Assange, as well as his imprisonment in a particular institution, that assurance remains extremely narrow and can easily be circumvented. In reality, on any given day, approximately 80,000 prisoners are being held in solitary confinement across the United States. Only a few hundred of them are imprisoned at ADX Florence, and only about fifty are under SAMs. In fact, most federal and state prisons in the United States have a solitary confinement unit, where inmates are isolated for a range of punitive, disciplinary or administrative reasons. Instead of ‘Special Administrative Measures’, these detention regimes may be called ‘Administrative Segregation’, ‘Restrictive Housing’, ‘Communication Management Units’ or ‘Involuntary Protective Custody’, and may be imposed by an authority other than the US attorney-general. But in essence it all amounts to the same torturous practice of keeping inmates locked up in tiny concrete cells with no meaningful activity or human interaction for more than twenty-two hours per day, often for prolonged periods ranging from several weeks to several decades, and without any effective legal remedy. In result, the assurances given would do nothing to protect Assange from being held in prolonged solitary confinement and other cruel, inhuman or degrading detention conditions.

As for the assured medical and psychological treatment, this would depend entirely on the assessment and recommendations made by a doctor or nurse employed at the prison where Assange is incarcerated, which in reality is of the same value as making no assurance at all. Finally, Assange’s assured eligibility for serving his US custodial sentence in Australia only becomes relevant ‘following conviction, sentencing and the conclusion of any appeals’. Assange would therefore have to remain in the United States for the entire duration of his legal proceedings and until the exhaustion of all legal remedies. Given the complexities of his case, this entire process could well last a decade or more. In other words, as a matter of law, none of the assurances made by the United States would provide Assange with any legal protection from being subjected to prolonged solitary confinement, excessive shackling, sensory deprivation, medical negligence, and various other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment routinely employed in the US prison system.

Just as importantly, of course, these assurances do not even begin to address any of the legal issues of paramount importance that were simply swept under the carpet by Judge Baraitser. This includes, most notably, the massive due process violations Assange has been exposed to through unlawful surveillance and irregular confiscation of his belongings by the United States, the notoriously unfair trial awaiting him at the Espionage Court in Alexandria, and the fundamentally flawed nature of the US indictment in view of press freedom protections, the prohibition of extradition for political offences, the fabrication of false witness testimonies and the reported discussions at the highest levels of the US government of kidnapping, irregularly rendering or even assassinating Assange. In order for any of these issues to receive a proper judicial review, along with the systematic violation of Assange’s rights during the British proceedings, his legal team must be allowed to cross-appeal.

On 11 August 2021, High Court Justices Timothy Holroyde and Judith Farbey upheld an appeal by the US government against Justice Swift’s decision of 5 July and granted the United States permission to appeal Baraitser’s ruling on all five grounds, including challenging the evidence on Assange’s mental health and suicide risk. The main appeals hearing was held on 27 and 28 October 2021 before Chief Justice Ian Duncan Burnett, the most senior judge in England and Wales, and, again, Justice Holroyde. The hearing did not bring any surprises. The US presented its case, attacked the credibility of the medical experts and evidence relied upon by Judge Baraitser, downplayed Assange’s health issues and suicide risk and emphasized the beneficial effects of the assurances offered. The defence team in turn insisted on the reliability of the relevant medical evidence and demonstrated how easily the US diplomatic assurances could be circumvented in practice. By and large, the judges asked questions of clarification and, at the end of the second day, concluded the hearing without announcing a date for the rendering of their judgment.

So, where do we go from here? Which one of the many conceivable scenarios will materialize? Will the British High Court of Justice live up to its honourable name, function and reputation? Will the judges have the personal courage and professional integrity to call the bluff of the US government’s assurances and reject their appeal? Will they call out the British authorities for their corrupt persecution of Assange, and overturn Baraitser’s unsustainable judicial precedent? Or will they choose the path of least resistance, and allow themselves to be instrumentalized? Will they engage in wilful blindness, self-deception and judicial contortion, and either allow the extradition to go forward or perpetuate Assange’s arbitrary detention in Belmarsh by sending the case back to the Magistrates’ Court for retrial?

While it is difficult to predict the exact evolution of these proceedings in the coming months and potentially even years, from a legal perspective they have long become a travesty of justice whose sole purpose is to silence Assange and to intimidate journalists and the broader public worldwide.

From a strictly procedural point of view, after the British High Court, both parties could appeal to the highest court in the United Kingdom, the Supreme Court. After that, if extradition is confirmed, Assange could still appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. At the snail’s pace currently imposed by the British judiciary, all of these procedural steps and remedies could take several years – and this is discounting the duration of subsequent proceedings at the ‘Espionage Court’ and related legal remedies in the United States. After more than a decade of judicial persecution in four jurisdictions, one cannot help but hear the chilling echoes of Stratfor’s 2010 recommendation: ‘Pile on. Move him from country to country to face various charges for the next twenty-five years.’

In my assessment, in terms of legal process and the enormous socio-political risks associated with it, the trial of Julian Assange may well prove to be the biggest judicial scandal of our times. The merciless persecution that this man has been exposed to, and the shameless betrayal of justice and human rights demonstrated by all the governments involved are beyond disgraceful – they profoundly undermine the credibility, integrity and sustainability of Western democracy and the rule of law.

By now, it is clear that the United States will never succeed in building a legally sustainable case against Assange, whether under the Espionage Act or under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act or any other legislation, and that his publishing activities related to WikiLeaks are fully protected under international human rights law and the First Amendment of the US Constitution. It is therefore high time for this hopeless case to be abandoned and for Assange’s freedom and human dignity to be restored, along with the credibility and integrity of the United States and its allies in terms of press freedom, justice and rule of law.

But let us also remember that, so far, the letter of the law has been all but irrelevant in this case and that the only decisive factors throughout all involved jurisdictions have been political interests. Ultimately, therefore, the fate of Julian Assange depends on President Joe Biden and his administration. For eight years, Biden was vice president in the Obama administration, which declined to prosecute Assange but never explicitly guaranteed him immunity from prosecution. Even when President Obama finally commuted Manning’s sentence, he opted not to let Assange off the hook but to perpetuate the deterrent effect of his confinement at the Ecuadorian embassy.

It is to be hoped that Biden has more to offer than repeating Obama’s mistakes. In December 2010 Vice President Biden described Assange as a ‘high-tech terrorist’, but he did so on the basis of assumptions that have since been disproved. In the same month, Biden also publicly acknowledged that WikiLeaks’ releases had caused ‘no substantive damage’ other than to be ‘embarrassing’ for the US government. May he now be inspired by another predecessor of his, former president Jimmy Carter, who once said, ‘I did not deplore the WikiLeaks revelations. They just made public what was actually the truth. Most often, the revelation of the truth, even if it’s unpleasant, is beneficial … I think that, almost invariably, the secrecy is designed to conceal improper activities and not designed for the well-being of the general public.’

Indeed, today it is palpably obvious that Assange is not an enemy of the United States or of any other country in the world. Rather, he is an inconvenient truthteller and messenger, who holds up a mirror to all of us and shines a spotlight on our systemic and societal failures. Sure, we can angrily smash this mirror and make the unwanted reflection go away, but the harmful effects of our collective shortcomings will still be there. The only honest response to this challenge is to leave the mirror intact and even polish it, so that we may better see and correct our own failures. Anything else is a denial of reality comparable to ignoring the fire alarm in the house of our civilization, and comes at a price which we, as a species, soon will no longer be able to afford.

Whether President Biden will have the wisdom, integrity, and courage to end the persecution of Assange remains to be seen. For these three – wisdom, integrity, and courage – are the qualities that make a great statesman, those which only few have the strength to honour when it matters most, and without which not one of the great global challenges of our time can be resolved.
